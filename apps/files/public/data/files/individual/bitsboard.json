It allows users to import existing learning lessons or create their own. These lessons are referred to as boards.","Each Bitsboard board is saved as a directory that includes the images and/or audio files used by that board. Most boards also include a Bitsboard.plist file, which is an XML file that describes a board's contents.","Typically, Bitsboard users share boards by uploading them to Bitsboard's online board catalog. However, users can also share a board by exporting the board to Dropbox. In some cases, users may Zip-compress the boards they export to Dropbox, to store and share them more efficiently. In these cases, users often rename these Zip-compressed boards to use the .bitsboard extension, so others know the files contain Bitsboard boards."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"bitsboard.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
