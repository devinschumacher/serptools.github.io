Bio-Rad sells real-time PCR (also known as qPCR) machines that use CFX Maestro software to gather and analyze data created during the PCR process.","Real-time PCR machines that use CFX Maestro software save PCR analyses as PCRD files. Users with access to CFX Maestro or CFX Manager can open PCRD files to view the data and analyses they contain. While some PCRD files were previously saved as XML files, PCRD files are now saved as encrypted archives, which can be opened only with Bio-Rad software."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pcrd.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
