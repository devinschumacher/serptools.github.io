These presentations can contain a combination of screen recordings, annotations, slides, images, and interactive content (such as quizzes).","Each ActivePresenter project is saved as an APPROJ file. These files are SQLite databases that store all a presentation's content. After finalizing a presentation, users can export their APPPROJ file's contents as an .MP4 , .PDF , or .HTML file, or as a series of .PNG images, to share the content with others. They can also publish the presentation to ActivePresenter's eLearning management system."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/approj_12696.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .approj file in Atomi ActivePresenter","caption":"APPROJ file open in Atomi ActivePresenter"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"approj.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
