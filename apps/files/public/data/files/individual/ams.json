This music tracker allows users to create synthesized music, by keying in notes or importing audio samples and playing them using one or more synthesized instruments.","Songs created using Velvet Studio are saved as AMS files. Often, users stored their AMS files in the C:/​SOUND/​MODULES/​AMS directory. While Velvet Studio is now legacy software, users can still open their AMS files in Velvet Studio and some other, current music trackers."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/ams_1684.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .ams file in OpenMPT","caption":"AMS file open in OpenMPT"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/ams_1683.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .ams file in OpenMPT","caption":"AMS file open in OpenMPT"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ams.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
