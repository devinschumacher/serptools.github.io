These 3D storyboards are referred to as previsualizations. FrameForge saves users' previsualization projects as PREVIZ files.","A user can open a PREVIZ file in FrameForge to see and play the shots it contains, and edit those shots as needed. Users can also export the storyboard a PREVIZ file contains as an .HTML file, a series of images, or a slideshow.","NOTE: FrameForge Storyboard Studio uses a variety of related but slightly-distinct PREVIZ file formats. For example, a macOS user can save PREVIZ files in a Mac-only file format, a cross-platform file format, or a version 2 file format."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/previz_12385.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .previz file in FrameForge Storyboard Studio","caption":"PREVIZ file open in FrameForge Storyboard Studio"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"previz.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
