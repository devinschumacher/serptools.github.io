This format is used to store various kinds of RGB images, saved with many different extensions.","SGI images saved with the .rgba extension contain three color channels (red, green, and blue) and a fourth, alpha channel. The alpha channel sets the transparency of the image's pixels. Each pixel can be anywhere from 0 to 100 percent transparent. This allows users to layer an RGBA image over another image, to produce a composite image via transparency."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/rgba_10256.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .rgba file in qView","caption":"RGBA file open in qView"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"rgba.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
