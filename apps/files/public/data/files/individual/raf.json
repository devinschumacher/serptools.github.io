For example, most RAF files store uncompressed image data, but more recent Fujifilm X-T3 and X-Pro2 cameras allow you to compress RAF files to reduce their size and save storage space.","Additionally, more recent Fujifilm cameras, like the X100V, allow you to capture images in the HDR RAF format (images captured when the HDR setting is enabled on the camera in the RAW mode). In these cases, the camera captures three images with different exposure levels and saves them all in one RAF file.","Professional photographers and camera hobbyists utilizing Fujifilm cameras will most likely encounter the RAF format. When transferring images from their camera, they may view or edit the RAF files with an image editor, then send them to print, incorporate them into digital artwork, or archive them for later use.","Additionally, RAF is one of many proprietary camera raw formats developed by digital camera manufacturers. Other camera raw formats include Canon .CR3 , Sony .ARW , and Nikon .NEF formats. Photographers using digital cameras from these manufacturers will likely work with these formats."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/raf_1428.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .raf file in Ichikawa Soft Laboratory RAW FILE CONVERTER EX 3","caption":"RAF file open in Ichikawa Soft Laboratory RAW FILE CONVERTER EX 3"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"raf.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
