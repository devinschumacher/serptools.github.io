Since AutoCAD is a leading CAD program, many other CAD programs also support the DWG format for importing and exporting technical drawings.","Over time, Autodesk has introduced several versions of the DWG file format, such as DWG 2000, DWG 2004, DWG 2007, DWG 2010, DWG 2013, and DWG 2018, each with slight structural differences. While these versions all use the .dwg file extension, compatibility with third-party CAD software may vary, as some programs may only support specific DWG versions.","NOTE: DWG files are closely related to .DXF files, which are text-based ( ASCII ) versions of DWG files designed for easier sharing and compatibility across different CAD applications."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/dwg_256.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .dwg file in Autodesk AutoCAD 2025","caption":"DWG file open in Autodesk AutoCAD 2025"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"dwg.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
