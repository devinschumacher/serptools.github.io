For example, a remote worker may use AnyDesk to access their work computer from their home computer, provided both machines have AnyDesk installed.","While using AnyDesk to access a computer, users can record their remote desktop session. For example, a user might want to record themselves performing a certain task, so they can share the recording as a tutorial. AnyDesk saves session recordings as ANYDESK files.","ANYDESK files contain a recording of everything that occurred on a user's screen while the recording was active. Users can configure AnyDesk to start a recording whenever they launch a remote desktop session, or users can manually start and stop recording their sessions.","NOTE: AnyDesk typically saves ANYDESK files in the ~/​Videos/​AnyDesk directory."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"anydesk.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
