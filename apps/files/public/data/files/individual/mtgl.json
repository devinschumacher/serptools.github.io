Investigators can then use the data they find to continue searching for even more related data, creating an information network that includes a score of names, email addresses, locations, phone numbers, and website information.","These information networks, which contain arrows indicating how various pieces of information relate to each other, are called Maltego graphs, and they are saved as MTGL files. Investigators can share MTGL files with each other to allow others to add to or analyze their investigations."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mtgl.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
