The EV3 Intelligent Brick is a miniature, programmable computer that students use to control LEGO robots, which are built from the LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 Core Set.","Programs that students create using EV3 Classroom are saved as LMSP files. In EV3 Classroom, the code that LMSP files contain appears as blocks, which students can drag and drop to change the functions their program includes. After a student has finished editing the program their LMSP file contains, they can install the file on their EV3 Intelligent Brick. They can then attach the Brick to a LEGO robot designed to execute their program and watch as the robot performs the functions their program contains.","NOTE: LMSP files are Zip-compressed files that contain an .SB3 , .SVG , and .jsn file. Students will likely never have to decompress an LMSP file, but doing so and examining the file's decompressed contents could be a valuable educational exercise."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/lmsp_12012.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .lmsp file in LEGO Education EV3 Classroom 1.1","caption":"LMSP file open in LEGO Education EV3 Classroom 1.1"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"lmsp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
