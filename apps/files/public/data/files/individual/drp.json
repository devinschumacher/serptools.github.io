It allows users to combine, layer, trim, and add effects to video, audio, and image files, before combining the files into a final, rendered video.","By default, DaVinci Resolve does not save users' video editing projects in a single file. Instead, it saves the configuration files that comprise a project in Resolve's installation directory. However, if you want to manually back up a project, you can export the project as a DRP file. You can do this by selecting File â†’ Export Project... from Resolve's menu bar.","NOTE: If you save your project as a DRP file, keep in mind that you will also have to retain copies of the media files your project contains, as DRP files contain only a record of a project's timeline, edits, and settings."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/drp_11228.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .drp file in Blackmagic Design DaVinci Resolve 17","caption":"DRP file open in Blackmagic Design DaVinci Resolve 17"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/drp_12007.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .drp file in NCH Software DrawPad 1.7","caption":"DRP file open in NCH Software DrawPad 1.7"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"drp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
