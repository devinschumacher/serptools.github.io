{"slug":"yoti","extension":"yoti","name":"Yoti Recovery File","category":"yoti-recovery-file","summary":"","developer_org":"yoti","developer_name":"Yoti","more_information":{"description":["Yoti is an identity verification app that allows users to import pictures and documents to create an identification card. The user can then show their card or reference their Yoti account while shopping or performing other transactions, to verify their identity.","If a user wants to \"back up\" their Yoti account, they can do so by creating a Yoti recovery file. This file, named RECOVERY.yoti , does not actually contain any of the user's Yoti account information. Instead, it contains a recovery key that Yoti's servers use to reconnect the user with their account (e.g. if the user switches phones and re-downloads Yoti).","Users who created a YOTI file from their iPhone can find the file in their iCloud. Users who created a YOTI file from an Android device can find the file in their Google Drive. YOTI files are created by selecting More → Settings → Account settings → My recovery file in Yoti."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"yoti.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
