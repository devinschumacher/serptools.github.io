Many games developed using RAGE include YMT files. The metadata these files contain define various universal and game-specific attributes.","For example, most RAGE games include a YMT file that defines game characters' attributes and a YMT file related to the game's physics engine. However, only Grand Theft Auto RAGE games include a YMT file that defines what cars appear in the games' street traffic. For this reason, how many and what type of YMT files a game contains varies from game to game."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ymt.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
