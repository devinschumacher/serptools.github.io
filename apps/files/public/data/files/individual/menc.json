Therefore, MENC files can be transferred to a PC using Windows ActiveSync or Windows Mobile Device Center, but it may not be possible to decrypt the file on the computer. Also, changing the GUID on a MENC file will disable the ability of the decryption program to properly decrypt the file.","To avoid encrypting files, go to Settings → System or Settings → Security on the Windows Mobile device and uncheck the box that says \"Encrypt files placed on storage cards.\""]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"menc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
