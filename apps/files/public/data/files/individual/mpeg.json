In 1993, MPEG created MPEG-1, the initial version of MPEG video and audio compression. Then, in 1995, MPEG released MPEG-1's successor, MPEG-2. Both MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 compression standards have been utilized in encoding video for over-the-air digital television broadcasts, DVDs, and home movies.","NOTE: MPEG files may also use the .MPG file extension and are now more commonly saved as .MP4 files, which utilize MPEG-4 compression."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/mpeg_62.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .mpeg file in VideoLAN VLC media player 3","caption":"MPEG file open in VideoLAN VLC media player 3"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mpeg.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
