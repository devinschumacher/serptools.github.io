To create an MP14 file, select File → Projects and packing → New project... and choose the location to save the MP14 file. The MP14 will be created and stored in a project folder in the save location you chose. To open an MP14 file, simply double-click the MP14 file or select File → Projects and packing → Open project... .","Multisim appends a number to project file extensions, which indicates the Multisim version that created the project. For example, Multisim 12 creates the .MP12 file extension and Multisim 13 creates the .MP13 file extension. Also, Multisim supports older project formats, which means that version 14 of Multisim can still open an .MP8 project created by version 8 of Multisim."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/mp14_10599.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .mp14 file in National Instruments Multisim 14","caption":"MP14 file open in National Instruments Multisim 14"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mp14.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
