{"slug":"pvt","extension":"pvt","name":"Renamed Live Photo","category":"renamed-live-photo","summary":"","developer_org":"apple","developer_name":"Apple","more_information":{"description":["In most cases, Apple AirDrop and other image-sharing services correctly share Live Photos as HEIC or converted image files. For example, when you AirDrop a Live Photo from your iPhone to a Mac, the photo appears as an HEIC file. And when you share a Live Photo via Apple Mail, the app automatically converts the photo to the .JPG format.","However, on some rare occasions, Live Photos are instead shared as PVT files. If you are encountering this issue, you may want to disable the Live Photos feature, by tapping the Live Photos button that appears in the upper-right corner of your iPhone's Camera app."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pvt.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
