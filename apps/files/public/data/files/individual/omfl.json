To do so, users add files, folders, and URLs to Open Multiple Files' Files, Folders, URLs list. The user then clicks the program's OPEN MULTIPLE FILES button to open all the items they added to the list.","If a user expects they'll want to open the same set of items multiple times (for example, because they are working on a project that uses files stored in multiple folders), they can save that set as an Open Multiple Files file list, or OMFL file. To quickly open the set of files again, a user can load their OMFL file in Open Multiple Files and click the program's OPEN MULTIPLE FILES button."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/omfl_12032.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .omfl file in Vovsoft Open Multiple Files","caption":"OMFL file open in Vovsoft Open Multiple Files"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"omfl.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
