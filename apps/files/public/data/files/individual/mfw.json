Fusion applications are saved in MFA files. If a developer is developing several related Fusion applications at the same time, they can save those applications as a Fusion project. The project is saved as an MFW file.","MFW files contain references to each application a project includes. Fusion uses these references to find and load each application when a developer opens the MFW file. If a developer has moved or renamed an MFA file that an MFW file references, Fusion will not be able to open that application as part of the project."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mfw.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
