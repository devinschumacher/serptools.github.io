While Drive for Desktop stores actual backups of some types of files (such as .JPG and .DOCX files) on users' computers, it does not store copies of files created using Google Docs, Sheets, Sites, and other Google Workspace applications. Instead, Drive for Desktop stores shortcut files that, when double-clicked, open the associated file in the web version of the correct Google Workspace application.","GSHEET files are Drive for Desktop shortcuts that open Google Sheets spreadsheets. When a Drive for Desktop user double-clicks a GSHEET file, the related spreadsheet opens in Google Sheets, provided the user is signed in to a Gmail account allowed to access the spreadsheet. Each GSHEET file is a JSON file that contains a spreadsheet's URL and document ID, as well as the name of the Gmail account used to create the spreadsheet.","NOTE: GSHEET files were previously created by Backup and Sync from Google. Google replaced Backup and Sync with Drive for Desktop in October 2021."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/gsheet_7629-2.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .gsheet file in GitHub Atom","caption":"GSHEET file open in GitHub Atom"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gsheet.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
