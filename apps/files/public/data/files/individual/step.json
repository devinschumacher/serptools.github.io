Since its release in 1994, STEP has become a standardized, widely-supported format that CAD users can use to save and transfer models between users and programs.","While STEP files appear as 3D models in CAD programs, they consist of plain text that describes a model's structure. The text that STEP files contain is written in an ASCII format that conforms to the STEP Application Protocols ISO 10303-2xx.","NOTE: STEP model files often use the .STP file extension."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/step_2964.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .step file in Autodesk Fusion 360 2.0","caption":"STEP file open in Autodesk Fusion 360 2.0"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/step_2964-2.png","alt":"STEP file open in Microsoft Notepad","caption":"STEP file open in Microsoft Notepad"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"step.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
