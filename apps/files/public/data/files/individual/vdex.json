The VDEX format was another iteration in Google's attempts to optimize Android apps' compilation and loading process. When a user installs an Android app, Android automatically optimizes that app and creates a corresponding .OAT and VDEX file. Referencing these files, rather than recompiling apps upon each load or update, allows Android to load apps more quickly, creating a better user experience.","VDEX files contain optimized versions of previously validated DEX (Dalvik Executable) files, which Android has noted that it does not need to re-extract and re-verify when recompiling an app. VDEX files are typically stored alongside OAT files, in an Android device's /​data/​dalvik-cache directory."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vdex.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
