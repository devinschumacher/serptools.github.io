EDRW files are compressed and optimized for easy sharing, especially with collaborators who don't have access to the original CAD software.","EDRW files are designed specifically for eDrawings Viewer (also known simply as \"eDrawings\"), a free application for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. The EDRW is read-only (users cannot edit it), making it a good option for securely distributing technical drawings for review and presentation.","NOTE: Dassault Systemes SolidWorks eDrawings Viewer can also create EDRW files, but the majority of users export the files with the eDrawings Publisher plugin."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/edrw_3965.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .edrw file in Dassault Systemes SolidWorks eDrawings Viewer","caption":"EDRW file open in Dassault Systemes SolidWorks eDrawings Viewer"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"edrw.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
