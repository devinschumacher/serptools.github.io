After encrypting a user's files, ransomware programs produce a ransom note that instructs users on how they can (supposedly) pay a ransom to restore their files.","R2U ransomware encrypts a user's files and renames them to use the .r2u extension, producing filenames that end in extensions like .jpg.r2u . It then produces a ransom note named readme.txt .","Ransomware is most commonly distributed in email attachments and programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles.
