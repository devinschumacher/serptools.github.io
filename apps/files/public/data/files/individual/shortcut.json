{"slug":"shortcut","extension":"shortcut","name":"Apple Shortcuts Shortcut","category":"apple-shortcuts-shortcut","summary":"","developer_org":"fanix-software","developer_name":"Fanix Software","more_information":{"description":["Apple Shortcuts is an app that allows iPhone and iPad users to automate multi-step actions they perform on their mobile devices, so they can perform those actions with a single button tap. These automated actions are referred to as shortcuts. Each shortcut appears as a separate button in Apple Shortcuts and is saved in its own SHORTCUT file.","If a user wants to share one of their Apple Shortcuts shortcuts with another user, they can tap the app's Share button and create an iCloud link. Other users can enter the link's URL in their web browser to download and install the shortcut. Users cannot manually save and send each other SHORTCUT files to install shortcuts, as Shortcuts does not allow users to import shortcuts from anywhere other than iCloud."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"shortcut.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
