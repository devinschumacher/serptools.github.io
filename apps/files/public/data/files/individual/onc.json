Theoretically, users using multiple types of operating systems and devices can load the settings an ONC file contains to connect to one or more networks. However, as of 2022, only Chrome OS devices use ONC files to connect to a network.","Each ONC file contains a list of one or more network specifications. These specifications include the network's name, type, connection credentials, and other settings. For example, an ONC file that contains information about a Wi-Fi network would specify that network's name, the type of security the network uses, and the password used to join the network.","Typically, ONC files are saved in a plain text JSON format. However, ONC files can also be encrypted and password-protected, so users cannot use them if they do not know the file's password."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/onc_12987.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .onc file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"ONC file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"onc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
