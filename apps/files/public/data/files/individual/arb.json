This template file contains a single JSON table, which lists all the app's strings in the app's default language. Developers can then copy this table into another file, replace the default strings with internationalized versions of their strings, and save the resulting ARB file(s) to create a translation file(s) for their application.","After creating all the translation files their app needs, developers can convert their ARB files into DART files and import them into their app, for use in localization-related code."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/arb_12437.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .arb file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"ARB file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"arb.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
