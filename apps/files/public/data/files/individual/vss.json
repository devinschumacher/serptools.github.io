Visio comes with VSS files pre-installed, and users may create them, as well.","The VSS format was more common in the 2000s when Visio saved stencils as VSS files by default. However, Microsoft replaced VSS files ( binary-based ) with the .VSSX format ( Zip-based ) when it released Visio 2013. Visio 2013 and later versions still support VSS files."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/vss_523.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .vss file in The Omni Group OmniGraffle 7","caption":"VSS file open in The Omni Group OmniGraffle 7"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vss.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
