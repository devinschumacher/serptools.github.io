Additionally, Blackmagic Design developed the BRAW codec to replace other video codecs by providing higher-quality video at similar file sizes. Blackmagic Design released the BRAW format in 2018.","A second feature is that the BRAW codec allows you to choose between 2 encoding methods:","A third feature of the BRAW format is that it stores a lot of metadata. With abundant metadata, the software viewing the BRAW video with the open-source Blackmagic RAW SDK better understands how the camera sensor captured the video subject. This produces video that better represents the lighting and color of the subject it captures.","Digital video cameras embed the metadata in the BRAW format. However, when you modify BRAW video with DaVinci Resolve, the application generates a .SIDECAR file to store the changes in JSON format. The SIDECAR storage option allows you to override BRAW metadata without overwriting and erasing the original metadata."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/braw_12842.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .braw file in Blackmagic RAW Player 2.3","caption":"BRAW file open in Blackmagic RAW Player 2.3"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"braw.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
