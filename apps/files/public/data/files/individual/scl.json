Otherwise, the Sibelius program allows you to create, open, edit, and remove chord diagrams directly through the interface.","To create a chord diagram library, select Create → Chord Diagram → New Chord Diagram Library... . You can add a chord to the library, select the chord and click \"Add to Library.\" After you create a chord diagram library, Sibelius saves it in an SCL file and stores it in the \"Chord Shapes\" folder, which is located in the \"Resources\" folder in the main \"Sibelius\" program folder."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/scl_13046.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .scl file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"SCL file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"scl.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
