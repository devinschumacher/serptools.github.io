They then convert them to various formats, such as HTML5 , SCORM, or xAPI, for use in learning management systems (LMS), such as Blackboard or Moodle.","For example, a corporate training specialist at a large company might use Articulate Storyline 360 to design an employee onboarding course. The STORY file would contain slides with interactive quizzes, branching scenarios, and embedded videos to engage new hires and teach company policies. While this format is proprietary to Articulate Storyline, the specialist could export the content to HTML5 and publish it on Blackboard.","NOTE: SCORM is a standardized format for LMS that tracks learner progress and interactions. Also, xAPI (Tin Can API) is a more advanced LMS format that records detailed learning experiences beyond traditional course structures."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/story_13796.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .story file in Articulate Storyline 360 3.97","caption":"STORY file open in Articulate Storyline 360 3.97"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"story.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
