The suite's programs, including GeoGebra Classic, GeoGebra Graphing Calculator, and other graphing applications, allow teachers and students to graph and analyze various mathematical data.","When a teacher or student saves a GeoGebra graph, that graph is saved as a GeoGebra worksheet, or GGB file. Teachers often create GGB files and send them to students, so the students can solve problems the teacher has included on the worksheet. The student then saves their own copy of the GGB file, which contains their answers.","NOTE: A GGB file may also be part of a dynamic GeoGebra worksheet. In this case, the file must be stored alongside an accompanying .HTML and .JAR file, which are also used to open the worksheet."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/ggb_3339.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .ggb file in GeoGebra Classic 6","caption":"GGB file open in GeoGebra Classic 6"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ggb.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
