File archives using the \".rxx\" file extensions format may be created using RAR for Mac and Unix or WinRAR for Windows.","NOTE: The WinRAR software installer registers file associations for the file extensions .R00 - R29, but it does not register associations for R30 and beyond. Therefore, you may see a WinRAR icon for R00 - R29 files but not for R30 files, even though WinRAR can still open R30 files that are part of a split archive."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"r30.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
