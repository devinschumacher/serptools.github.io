Among other things, this environment allows users to load homebrew applications saved as RPX or WUHB files directly from their Wii U's home menu. The WUHB format was released alongside Aroma.","Unlike RPX files, WUHB files can include more than just a homebrew application's executable . They can also include additional assets, metadata files, instructions, images, and other data. For example, a WUHB file can include an app splash screen, an app icon, and a metadata file that lists the app's author and version.","NOTE: Homebrew developers can create WUHB files using the wut (Wii U Toolchain) homebrew development tool."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"wuhb.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
