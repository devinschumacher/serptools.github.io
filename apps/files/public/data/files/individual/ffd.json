WildTangent released FATE in 2005.","When a FATE player saves their game, the game creates a corresponding FFD file. FFD files are numbered in the order they were created. For example, a player's first saved game will be named 0.ffd , the second 1.ffd , and so on. FATE typically stores FFD files in the game's SAVE directory."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ffd.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
