This variant encrypts users' files and appends them with the wiot extension. The ransomware then produces a plain text ransom note named _readme.txt in every folder that contains an infected file. The note contains instructions users are supposed to follow to decrypt their files.","WIOT ransomware is most commonly distributed in programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed an unverified program, that may be how WIOT ransomware infected your computer.","NOTE: To learn more about STOP ransomware and its variants, refer to the .STOP entry."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"wiot.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
