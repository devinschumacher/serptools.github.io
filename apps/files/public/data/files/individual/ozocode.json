The Ozobot platform includes an online code editor, called OzoBlockly, that students use to create programs for Ozobots, which are miniature, nearly-spherical robots that can perform a variety of simple functions.","If a student downloads a program they have created in OzoBlockly to their computer, the program is saved as an OZOCODE file. When opened in a text editor, OZOCODE files appear as .XML files that define what blocks a student's program includes, as well as the order in which the blocks are listed. To install the program an OZOCODE file contains on an Ozobot, you must open the program in OzoBlockly and pair your Ozobot with your computer."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/ozocode_11956.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .ozocode file in OzoBlockly","caption":"OZOCODE file open in OzoBlockly"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ozocode.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
