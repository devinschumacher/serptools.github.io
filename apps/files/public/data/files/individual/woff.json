Many browsers support the WOFF format, but most of them do not support WOFF files until recent versions. WOFF files are referenced within CSS files using the @font-face rule. WOFF files were replaced with .WOFF2 files, which are saved in the WOFF 2.0 format that features improved compression.","NOTE: FontForge allows you to create OTF and TTF font files from the WOFF file."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"woff.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
