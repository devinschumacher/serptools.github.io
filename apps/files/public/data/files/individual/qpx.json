The files were typically small in size, so users could more easily add or remove them based on their needs.","QPX extensions were beneficial during QuickTime Player's earlier years in the late 1990s and 2000s when compatibility with emerging media standards and formats frequently required extensions. However, the media player no longer supports QPX files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"qpx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
