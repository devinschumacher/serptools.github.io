Most of these tools, including rResPacker, are intended to help developers more efficiently develop video games.","While building their video game, developers can use rResPacker to package the game's assets in a single RRES file. This keeps the game's file structure more organized and prevents players from easily accessing game assets. RRES files may contain images, audio, fonts, and other assets.","NOTE: As of May 2022, the RRES format and rResPacker have yet to officially be released."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"rres.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
