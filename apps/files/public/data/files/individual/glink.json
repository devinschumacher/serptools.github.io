These shortcuts appear in Drive as GLINK files.","GLINK files may also appear on PCs that have Google Drive for Desktop or ChromeOS installed, because those apps synchronize with a user's Google Drive account. On these devices, GLINK files typically appear in the Google Drive folder.","NOTE: GLINK files were also previously created by Backup and Sync from Google. Google replaced Backup and Sync with Drive for Desktop in October 2021."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"glink.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
