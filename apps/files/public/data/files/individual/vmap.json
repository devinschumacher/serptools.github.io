VMAP files were introduced with the release of the Source 2 engine and replaced .VMF files, which are used by games with the Source 1 engine. VMAP files are most commonly used by DOTA 2 but may also be used for other games that use the Source 2 engine.","You can create and edit VMAP files with the Valve Hammer Editor, which is included in the Source SDK and DOTA 2 Workshop Tools. After you are done modifying a VMAP file, you must build it into a compiled map (VMAP_C file), which is packaged in a .VPK file. Select File â†’ Build Map , choose your settings, and click Build to compile the VMAP file."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vmap.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
