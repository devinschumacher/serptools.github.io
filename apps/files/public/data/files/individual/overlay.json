As part of setting up Streamlabs Desktop, streamers create one or more scenes. These scenes contain the elements a streamer wants to stream.","For example, a scene may include a game window, a window that shows the streamer's face via their webcam, and the streamer's logo (saved as a .PNG or other image file). When the streamer begins streaming, all these elements are combined into one streaming video.","If a streamer wants to export the graphical elements of their scenes (often referred to as overlays) as a single package, they can do so by:","This exports the graphical elements (and notably, not the video capture sources) of a streamer's current scenes as an OVERLAY file.
