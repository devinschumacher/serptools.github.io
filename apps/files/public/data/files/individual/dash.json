{"slug":"dash","extension":"dash","name":"MPEG-DASH Video File","category":"mpeg-dash-video-file","summary":"","developer_org":"dashlane","developer_name":"Dashlane","more_information":{"description":["DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) files are distributed over the DASH protocol. When clients , like web browsers, play back DASH-encoded content, they select DASH file segments with the appropriate bitrate to avoid re-buffering and stalls. The chosen bitrate reflects your current network and Internet connection.","A variety of programs allow users to create and download DASH files. For example, RealPlayer Downloader downloads videos as DASH files before automatically converting them to .MP4 files. As another example, developers can use DASHEncoder to create DASH videos from other video files.","If you have a DASH file on your computer, it is likely a segment of a larger video file. Because DASH files contain only a segment of a video, they cannot be played as is in most media players. You must combine a DASH file with its other related video segments and convert the combined file to an MP4 file before you can play it."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"dash.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
