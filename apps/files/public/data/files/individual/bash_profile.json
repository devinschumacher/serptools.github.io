In other words, they are executed after a user logs in with their login credentials, or when a new terminal window is created. This differs from .BASHRC files, which are run only when Bash shell scripts are executed within a terminal that is already open.","Since users often want to run both BASH_PROFILE and BASHRC files upon login, they often include the following segment in the BASH_PROFILE file, which forces the BASHRC file to be run when only the BASH_PROFILE file is executed:","if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]. Then source ~/.bashrc fi","NOTE: BASH_PROFILE files are hidden in a user's home directory and do not contain a filename prefix. They always use the filename .bash_profile ."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"bash_profile.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
