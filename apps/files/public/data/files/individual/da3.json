Since the story revolves around typing, verbs and nouns are important parts of the game. The list of usable verbs often stays the same from game to game. But nouns differ greatly from game to game. The nouns (most often objects) are interactive, you can do many different actions with nouns, such as carry, drop, unlock, open, and eat.","AGT games are often accompanied with a variety files. Each file contains game data, including .TTL , .VOC , and .INS files. Because of the large number of files that accompany the AGT game, the files can be converted into a single .AGX file with the AGT2AGX utility that comes with AGiliTy. This conversion reduces clutter, load time, and game size.","NOTE: DA3 files are similar to .DA2 , .DA4 , and .DA5 files. These files contain game data referenced for different aspects of the game."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"[name of the game].da3","description":"[name of the game].da3 - The DA3 file is named after the game it's created for."}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"da3.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
