These files make up the set data dictionary for the two or more tables linked together. The dictionary stores reports, forms, and any other objects linked to the set. SEM files should be kept with the SET and SEX Set Data Dictionary files in order for Alpha to find all of the elements and their pieces.","SET files are similar to .DBF files because they have a width limitation for how many characters can be held within a column. So Alpha Five creates a ten character field in SET files that references the memo location in the SEM file that contains the actual information.","NOTE: In 2013, Alpha Five became Alpha Anywhere."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"[Name of your set].sem","description":"[Name of your set].sem - When you create the set, the SEM file will be created with the same name as the related SET and SEX files."}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sem.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
