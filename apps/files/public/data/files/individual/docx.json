It replaced the .DOC file format as the standard format for saving documents in Word. Unlike DOC files, which store document data in a single binary file, DOCX files save data as separate files and folders in a compressed Zip package. Within a DOCX file are XML files and three folders: Word , docProps , and _rels , which store the content, document properties, and relationships between the files.","The Open XML format is designed to make document content more open and accessible. For example, document text is saved in plain text files, and document images are stored as individual image files, such as .JPG or .PNG , within the DOCX file. The included files may also contain page formatting information, authorship data, and document review notes.","NOTE: To explore the contents of a DOCX file, rename the .docx extension to .zip and then decompress the resulting file with any Zip decompression utility."],"screenshot":{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/docx_1429.png","srcset":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/md/docx_1429.png 760w, https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/docx_1429.png 380w","alt":"Screenshot of a .docx file in Microsoft Word 365","width":"380","height":"253","caption":"DOCX file open in Microsoft Word 365"}},"how_to_open":{"instructions":["You can open a DOCX file with Microsoft Word in Windows and macOS. Word is the best option for opening DOCX files because it fully supports the formatting of Word documents, which includes images, charts, tables, and text spacing and alignment. Word is also available for Android and iOS devices.","You can also open DOCX files with other word processors, but some of the formatting of the original documents may be lost. Alternative word processors that support DOCX files include Corel WordPerfect (Windows), Apple Pages (Mac), and LibreOffice Writer (multiplatform).","You can open DOCX files with various programs online.
