Additionally, Visual Basic (specifically VB.NET in the modern Visual Studio environment) no longer uses VBG files.","In the current VB.NET and Visual Studio environment, project organization and source control management are handled differently using Solution ( .SLN ) files, which organize and manage multiple projects. Additionally, source control in Visual Studio is now typically managed through modern tools like Git or Azure DevOps rather than the outdated Microsoft Visual SourceSafe system (a version control system officially discontinued in 2005 that also supported VBG files)."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vbg.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
