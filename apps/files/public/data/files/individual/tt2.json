During the installation process, the utility installs the programs included in the Office suite, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote.","As the utility installs the programs, it creates temporary files to hold data for files while they are being copied and placed in the correct directory. Once the copying is complete, the utility deletes the temporary files.","Due to a bug in the Microsoft Office Installer, the TT2 files storing data for TTF files are left, typically in the user's C:\\â€‹ drive. This does not mean that the TTF files were not placed in their correct locations. Instead, it means that the TT2 files are left to be found by a user instead of being deleted.","NOTE: You can delete the TT2 file since it contains duplicated data from a TTF file. Or you can restart Windows and the TT2 files will be removed."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"WindowsLEELAWAD.tt2","description":"WindowsLEELAWAD.tt2 - Contains same information as the LEELAWAD.TTF file for the Leelawadee Regular font."},{"filename":"WindowsLEELAWDB.tt2","description":"WindowsLEELAWDB.tt2 - Contains same information as the LEELAWDB.TTF file for the Leelawadee Bold font."}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tt2.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
