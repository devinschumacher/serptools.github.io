It was initially published by Intergraph, before being acquired by Bentley Systems.","Most versions of MicroStation allow users to open, create, and save DNG files. (Version 1 of MicroStation could only open DGN files, created by other Intergraph CAD programs.) However, different versions of MicroStation save DGN files in slightly different formats. Versions 7 and below of MicroStation save DGN files in the original ISFF format that Intergraph created in the 1980s. Versions 8 and above save DGN files in the V8 DGN format, created by Bentley Systems in 2000. Thus, old versions of MicroStation may not be able to open newer DGN files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"dgn.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
