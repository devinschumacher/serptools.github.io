This makes it useful for converting into other formats. The format features simple semantic markup, metadata embedding, unicode, and inline formatting.","Since FB2 files can grow large in size, due to embedded images, they are often compressed in .ZIP files in order to transfer them more easily over the Internet. In these cases, the \".fb2\" extension may be replaced with the \".zip\" or \".fb2.zip\" extension."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"fb2.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
