It allowed users to design, add content to, and even manually script their applications, before publishing them via CD, DVD, or a network.","Version 6 of Authorware saved users' app creation projects as A6P files. Saving a project as an A6P file allowed a user to continue editing their app, even after publication. For example, if a user found an issue with their published app, they could open the app's A6P file, fix the issue, and re-publish the fixed app.","NOTE: Adobe discontinued Authorware in 2007, after releasing Authorware 7."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"a6p.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
