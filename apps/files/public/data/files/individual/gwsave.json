As the player progresses through the game, they add new cards to their deck, acquire items, and experience numerous surprises.","Inscryption records a player's current deck, acquired items, map location, and other progress and achievements in a GWSAVE file, named SaveFile.gwsave . (It also backs up a player's prior saved game in SaveFile-Backup.gwsave .) This file is a plain text file, which consists of various sections associated with specific aspects of gameplay.","For example, the playerDeck section describes the contents of a player's current deck (including how cards in the deck have been modified in-game), while the playerLives section records the number of lives a player has left.
