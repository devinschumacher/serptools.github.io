Users could use UltraCompressor II to compress and store files in UC2 archives, in the interest of saving hard drive space or more easily sharing files with others. They could then use UltraExpander II to extract files from UC2 archives.","Notably, UltraCompressor II analyzed files' content before compressing them, allowing it to compress files more compactly than some of the era's other compression programs. However, this extra analysis increased UltraCompressor II's compression times."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"uc2.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
