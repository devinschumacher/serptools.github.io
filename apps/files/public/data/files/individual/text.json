Unlike .RTF , .DOCX , and .PAGES files, TEXT files cannot include advanced formatting, such as bolding, italicization, font styles, and text alignment.","Because TEXT files cannot include formatting, they typically contain only basic information, such as notes, step-by-step instructions, and program information logs. Software developers may also package TEXT files with games and tools they distribute to contain instructions or other information about the software.","Users who need to create more complicated text documents, such as resumes, reports, letters, or flyers, typically do not save those documents as TEXT files. Instead, they use Microsoft Word or Apple Pages to create and save documents as DOCX or PAGES files."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":".text","description":".text - Binary TEXT files are unnamed; only the .text file extension is present."},{"filename":".text","description":".text - Binary TEXT files are unnamed; only the .text file extension is present."}],"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/text_285.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .text file in Microsoft Notepad","caption":"TEXT file open in Microsoft Notepad"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/text_13169.png","alt":"Contents (including a .text file) extracted from an EXE or DLL file","caption":"Contents (including a .text file) extracted from an EXE or DLL file"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"text.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
