GDScript was created by the Godot community to provide custom integrated features that other programming languages, such as Lua , Python , and Squirrel did not provide out-of-the-box.","GD files may be run in Godot Engine or they may be edited with the script editor that comes with Godot Engine. The script editor includes helpful editing features, such as code completion and syntax highlighting. Developers may also edit GD files with plain text editors, such as Microsoft Notepad and Apple TextEdit, but they do not provide the same scripting features as Godot Engine.","NOTE: GDScript was introduced with version 3.1 and later of Godot Engine."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gd.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
