The game is so popular that modders have created a variety of KSP add-ons, including kOS.","kOS allows players to write and execute autopilot scripts, used to fly rockets automatically. These scripts are written in kOS's KerboScript programming language and saved as KS files.","Players execute KS files using custom KSP parts included in the kOS mod. A KS file may contain a simple script (for example, used just to automate a spaceship's launch) or a complex script (for example, used to steer a spaceship after launch). Typically, KS files are stored in the GameData/​Ships/​Script directory."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/ks_12800.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .ks file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"KS file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ks.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
