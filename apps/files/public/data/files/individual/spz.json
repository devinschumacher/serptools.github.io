The game is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and PlayStation 2 (PS2).","The PS2 version of Half-Life uses different assets than the PC versions. For example, while the PC versions of Half-Life use sprites saved as SPR files, the PS2 version uses sprites saved as SPZ files. These files are compressed SPR files, which must be decompressed before they can be opened with SPR viewers and editors."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"spz.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
