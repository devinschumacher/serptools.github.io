These files contain all the data captured when a photographer took a picture. Retaining this data in its original, unprocessed format allows photographers to edit image elements, such as color temperature and exposure, more precisely.","However, because KDC files contain a lot of data, they typically have quite large file sizes. For this reason, photographers typically convert KDC files to other formats after they've finished editing them in Kodak or third-party photo editing software.","NOTE: Kodak EasyShare P-Series and Z-Series cameras also save photos as KDC files. However, those cameras' KDC files are not formatted the same as DC-Series cameras' KDC files."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/kdc_201.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .kdc file in XnViewMP","caption":"KDC file open in XnViewMP"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"kdc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
