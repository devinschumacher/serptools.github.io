Each iPhone, Apple Watch, and iPad that can perform cellular functions includes a baseband processor.","Periodically, Apple updates baseband processors' firmware using BBFW files. These files are distributed within normal iOS and watchOS updates. As such, most Apple device users will never encounter a BBFW file. However, those who have jailbroken their devices, so they can manually manage their devices' firmware, may need to manually install a BBFW file as part of their firmware update process."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"bbfw.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
