Typically, users use Youtube-dl to download videos and save them as .MP4 or .MKV files, so they can play the videos offline in their favorite video player.","When downloading a video, youtube-dl creates a YTDL file. This file contains information about the download process. YTDL can use this information to resume the associated download if needed (for example, if the download is paused or interrupted).","NOTE: Youtube-dl is no longer regularly maintained and has largely been replaced by yt-dlp. Yt-dlp also creates YTDL files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ytdl.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
