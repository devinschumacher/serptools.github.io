Users can then export their animations and games as GIF, ZIP, or HTML files, for use in other projects or in their (or another user's) web browser.","While working on their Wick Editor projects, users can save those projects as WICK files. Each WICK file is a .ZIP archive, which contains an assets folder and a project.json file. The assets folder contains the project's assets, while the project.json file contains JSON-formatted data that Wick Editor uses to load the project."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/wick_12533.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .wick file in Wicklets Wick Editor","caption":"WICK file open in Wicklets Wick Editor"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"wick.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
