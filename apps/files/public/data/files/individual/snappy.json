However, the goal of Snappy is to be a fast compressor, not to achieve maximum compression. Therefore, while compressed files may be larger, they are compressed much more quickly.","NOTE: Snappy is distributed as a source code library written in C++."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"snappy.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
