This is because the text files can easily be reviewed in plain text against historical revisions. Projects created with GitHub, a popular online version control system, often use a file named README.markdown , which contains the readme for the source code.","A Perl program named \"Markdown\" is available for converting Markdown to HTML. It can be downloaded at the Daring Fireball website, which is maintained by John Gruber, the developer of Markdown.","NOTE: Markdown files may also use the .MD , .MARKDN , and .MDOWN extensions.
