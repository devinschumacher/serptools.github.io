You can then import the SSV file in the desktop version of Microsoft Excel .","You can also create an SSV file manually with plain text editors, such as Microsoft Notepad or Apple TextEdit . After saving the file, you can rename the .txt file extension to .ssv . However, manually creating an SSV file can be time-consuming if you have a lot of data.","NOTE: The first \"S\" in \"SSV\" might also stand for \"Space\" or \"Separator,\" meaning the values could be separated by a character other than semicolons."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/ssv_13720.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .ssv file in Apple Numbers 14","caption":"SSV file open in Apple Numbers 14"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/ssv_13720-2.png","alt":"SSV file open in Apple TextEdit 1","caption":"SSV file open in Apple TextEdit 1"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ssv.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
