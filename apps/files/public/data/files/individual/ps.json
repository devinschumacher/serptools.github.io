Adobe released the first version of PS in 1984 and subsequently released versions in 1991 and 1997. However, over time, other page layout formats, mainly .PDF , have primarily replaced the format.","The PS language is especially helpful for maintaining the design of page layouts when printing files across different operating systems and applications. Also, the language supports image scaling to varying resolutions without quality loss, which produces sharper images and text.","Since other page layout formats replaced the PS language, few applications support it, making it difficult to view PS designs. Also, the format tends to lead to bloated PS files, which can cause longer loading times."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/ps_82.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .ps file in Adobe Photoshop 2019","caption":"PS file open in Adobe Photoshop 2019"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ps.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
