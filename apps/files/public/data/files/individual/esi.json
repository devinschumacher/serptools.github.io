The standard is currently maintained by the EtherCAT Technology Group.","An EtherCAT network contains a controller that sends data as a \"telegram\" through all the network's nodes. The telegram passes through each node sequentially, such that node 1 can extract data from and add data to the telegram before sending it on to node 2. After it has passed through each node, the telegram returns to the controller.","Each node's ESI file controls how the node, which can be comprised of any number of devices, receives and sends data. The ESI file specifies what devices are contained within the node, how those devices are grouped, and what ports the devices use to send and receive data, among other settings.","NOTE: ESI files are often saved with the .XML extension."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/esi_11581.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .esi file in Apple Xcode","caption":"ESI file open in Apple Xcode"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"esi.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
