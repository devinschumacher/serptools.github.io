All of these applications save home designs in the CYP format and allow users to add CYG format objects.","In Ashampoo's CAD applications, CYG files appear primarily as 3D objects that can be selected from the programs' Catalog. However, the files contain both a 2D and 3D representation of an object, and they can be added to either a design's 2D or 3D view. As you add an object to one view, it is simultaneously added to the other.","NOTE: In Ashampoo CAD programs' Catalog, you can double-click a CYG object to view it at a larger size."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/cyg_12114.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .cyg file in Ashampoo 3D CAD Professional","caption":"CYG file open in Ashampoo 3D CAD Professional"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"cyg.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
