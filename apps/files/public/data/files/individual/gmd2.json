It includes a custom level creation system that allows players to create their own levels, share them online, and play levels designed by other players. However, there is no official way to export levels as local files.","To allow players to save custom levels locally, Geometry Dash enthusiast HJfod created the GDShare utility, which was succeeded by GDShare-mod. GDShare-mod integrates directly with Geomery Dash and allows users to export levels from and import levels into Geometry Dash. These levels are saved as GMD2 files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gmd2.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
