Once compiled, users can distribute U files and drop them into the appropriate folder to modify or extend a game, similar to a plugin . For example, a modder might create a new weapon or character class in UnrealScript, compile it into a U file, and then load it into Unreal Tournament to use it during gameplay.","U files are typically stored in the game's System folder (for example, \\​Unreal\\​System\\​ ). When a game launches, the engine loads the relevant U files from the System directory to access the necessary gameplay code."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"u.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
