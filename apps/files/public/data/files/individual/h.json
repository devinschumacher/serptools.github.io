{"slug":"h","extension":"h","name":"C/C++/Objective-C Header File","summary":"An H file is a header file referenced by a document written in C, C++, or Objective-C source code. It may contain variables, constants, and functions that are used by other files within a programming project. H files allow commonly used functions to be written only once and referenced by other source files when needed.","developer":"N/A","developer_slug":"n-a","category":"Developer Files","category_slug":"developer-files","rating":3.8,"votes":157,"last_updated":"June 17, 2020","more_information":{"content":["H header files are typically used to store C function declarations, as well as macro definitions, which can be used by multiple source files. Header files can be inserted into a .C source code file using the #include directive.","NOTE: H files may also store headers for C++ source code, but those headers are typically saved as .HPP files."]},"how_to_open":{"instructions":["Since header files are plain text files, you can open and view the file contents in a text editor. However, it's easier to edit *.h files and other source code files using a code editor like Microsoft Visual Studio or Apple Xcode . These editors provide helpful programming tools like line numbers, syntax highlighting, and source code error checking."]},"scraped_at":"2025-08-09T21:58:55.019903","source":{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/extension/h","file":"h.html"}}
