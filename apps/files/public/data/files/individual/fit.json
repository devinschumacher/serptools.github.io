For example, they are generated specifically by Garmin devices (e.g., GPS watches, fitness trackers, and bike computers). Also, the data in a Garmin FIT file may include Garmin-specific data extensions (e.g., proprietary metrics) that other platforms do not fully support.","Additionally, the Garmin Activity FIT format is similar to the .TCX format, but offers a more efficient and compact storage solution, allowing for faster data processing and reduced file sizes. This makes it a better choice for athletes who want to keep detailed records of their activities and track their progress across multiple devices and platforms."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"fit.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
