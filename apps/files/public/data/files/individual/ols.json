While using Publisher to create and publish documents, you can perform a mail (or email) merge. This allows you to import a mailing (or email) list and personalize your document for each person on the list (for example, by adding that person's name and address or a unique greeting).","As part of performing a mail merge, you must import a recipient list. Recipient lists can be imported from files saved in any of the following formats:","After you finish performing your mail merge, Microsoft Publisher will ask whether you want to save a shortcut to your imported recipient list, to make the list easier to select in the future. If you choose to save a shortcut, Publisher will create an OLS file, which links to your recipient list. The next time you perform a mail merge, you will be able to select this shortcut to more easily import the linked recipient list."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ols.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
