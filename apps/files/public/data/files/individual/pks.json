The files allow developers to separate an application's interface from its implementation.","This means a developer can change the logic in the PKB file without affecting programs that rely on the public definitions in the PKS file, as long as the interface remains the same. This separation improves code maintainability and helps with version control and security."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pks.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
