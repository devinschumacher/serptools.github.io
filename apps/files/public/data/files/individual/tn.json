The Tracor Northern (TN) format, as described by the U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report OF 98-248, is used by Tracor Northern (now NORAN Instruments) electronic microscopy test equipment for logging images with a 512x512 pixels, 8-bit grayscale format. These images use the \".sem\" extension, not the \".tn\" extension, and can be converted to .GIF files using the program SEM2GIF.EXE, or to a proprietary \".bin\" format using the program SEM2BIN.EXE. However, the \".sem\" image format is not the format used by modern mobile devices."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tn.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
