Via an ADP, Access users could connect to, open, and edit a Microsoft SQL Server database. This allowed database administrators to more easily create and manage Access applications that use SQL Server databases.","ADP files do not themselves contain any database data or objects. Instead, they contain data that Access uses to connect to, read data from, and make changes to an associated SQL Server database, using Microsoft's OLE DB architecture.","With the release of Access 2013, Microsoft discontinued the ADP format. As a result, Access 2013 and later versions cannot open ADP files. For more information about this change, refer to Microsoft's official documentation ."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"adp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
