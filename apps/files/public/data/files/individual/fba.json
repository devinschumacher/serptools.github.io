{"slug":"fba","extension":"fba","name":"Fitbit OS App Package","category":"fitbit-os-app-package","summary":"","developer_org":"fitbit","developer_name":"Fitbit","more_information":{"description":["Fitbit smartwatches use a proprietary operating system called Fitbit OS. Fitbit Studio is an integrated development environment ( IDE ) that allows developers to create Fitbit OS apps. Developers who prefer to develop from their own source code editor or the command line can use Fitbit's command-line interface instead of Fitbit Studio.","After a developer finishes developing their Fitbit OS app, they can package that app as an installable FBA file. They can then either install the app on their own Fitbit for testing or publish the app to the Fitbit App Gallery. Developers can publish apps to the gallery either publicly or privately. Private apps can be installed only using a direct installation hyperlink provided by the developer.","NOTE: FBA files can also contain Fitbit clockfaces, instead of Fitbit apps."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"fba.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
