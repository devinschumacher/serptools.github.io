As of 2018, all major web browsers support ES Modules.","However, the popularity of modularized JavaScript pre-dates ES6. Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment, used CommonJS as the specification for modules. Because so many existing applications were built with CommonJS, when Node.js added support for native ES modules, it controversially introduced the MJS file extension to differentiate the two and prevent applications from breaking.","NOTE: Some developers informally refer to MJS files as \"Michael Jackson Script\" files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mjs.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
