It is a compressed format that stores audio encoded at a bitrate of 13 Kbps.","Because the GSM format is primarily used in telephony, most GSM files contain telephone conversations. However, GSM files may also contain music or other audio, saved at the level of quality you'd expect from a telephone conversation."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/gsm_1726.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .gsm file in VideoLAN VLC media player","caption":"GSM file open in VideoLAN VLC media player"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gsm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
