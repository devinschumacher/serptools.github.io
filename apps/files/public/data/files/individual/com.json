You can also run a COM file in the 64-bit version of Windows with a virtual machine that supports the MS-DOS environment.","NOTE: If a folder includes both EXE and COM files with the same filename (e.g., run.exe and run.com ), the DOS or Windows command prompt will run the COM file if you type the filename without the extension."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"COMMAND.COM","description":"COMMAND.COM - The Windows shell program used by DOS and Windows 95, 98, and Me.
