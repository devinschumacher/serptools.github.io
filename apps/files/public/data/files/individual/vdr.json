VDR files look and act just like regular video files in Windows, even though they are being hosted and converted in the background by VirtualDub.","VDR files may also be seen with a \".vdr.avi\" double file extension, which may be used for programs that can only recognize an AVI video file with an ending \".avi\" extension. VirtualDub provides a proxy handler that registers VDR files alongside AVI files in Windows, but it may cause other programs to malfunction."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vdr.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
