The program's managed disk image creation feature, added in version 1.9, allows users to combine multiple disk image extractions together into a single disk image.","For example, if a user has a damaged DVD, they can use the managed disk image feature to extract data from that DVD using multiple DVD drives. Then, they can piece the resulting extractions (which may contain different data) together into a single disk image.","IsoBuster managed disk images are saved as an IBP file and one or more IBQ files. The IBP file contains metadata used to manage the IBQ file(s). If you do not possess both a disk image's IBP and IBQ file(s), you will not be able to open that disk image in IsoBuster."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ibp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
