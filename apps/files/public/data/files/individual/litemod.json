LITEMOD files should be placed in the \"mods\" folder, which is located inside the \".minecraft\" folder. If there is no \"mods\" folder, create one. Once installed, LITEMOD files are designed to not conflict with other installed mods and mod loaders, such as Minecraft Forge.","NOTE: When downloading LITEMOD files, your browser may detect the file as a .ZIP file and give it a \"zip\" extension. This will prevent the mod from properly working, so rename the extension to \"litemod\" before placing it in the \"mods\" folder."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"litemod.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
