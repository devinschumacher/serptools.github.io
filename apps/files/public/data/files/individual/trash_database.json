When you trash a file, it is placed in Files by Google's Trash folder and given a new .trashed filename.","For up to 30 days, you can restore a trashed file to its previous location. To help Files by Google replace restored files, the app maintains a TRASH_DATABASE file. This file contains a list of the locations at which trashed files previously resided and the files' original names. When you restore a trashed file, Files by Google uses the data its TRASH_DATABASE file contains to place the file where it belongs."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/trash_database_12623.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .trash_database file in Apple TextEdit","caption":"TRASH_DATABASE file open in Apple TextEdit"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"trash_database.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
