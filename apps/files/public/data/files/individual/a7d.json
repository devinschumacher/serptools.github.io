The flowline outlines the structure of your application with icons that can be dragged and dropped into the flowline. The model holds a custom structure of the icons (each icon represents a function) that can be inserted into a flowline. Models are very useful for maintaining continuity across applications, especially when working with a team of developers.","To create an A7D file, highlight your structure of icons, select File â†’ Save in Model... , name the file, choose the save location (should be placed in the \"Knowledge Objects\" folder in the Authorware directory), and click Save . You can now choose the model from the \"Knowledge Objects\" panel.","NOTE: Authorware 7 was the last version developed by Macromedia before Macromedia was acquired by Adobe Systems."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"a7d.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
