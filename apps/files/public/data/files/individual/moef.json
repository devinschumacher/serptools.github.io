It is designed to be a companion program to a video editor for creating an effect, title, transition, which is then imported into the video editor. Motion is most commonly used with Final Cut Pro because of its similar appearance and integration with the video editor."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"moef.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
