While Drive for Desktop stores actual backups of some types of files (such as .JPG and .DOCX files) on users' computers, it does not store copies of files created using Google My Maps, Docs, and other Google Workspace applications. Instead, Drive for Desktop stores shortcut files that, when double-clicked, open the associated file in the web version of the correct Google Workspace application.","GMAP files are Drive for Desktop shortcuts that open maps created in Google My Maps. When a Drive for Desktop user double-clicks a GMAP file, the related map opens in Google My Maps, provided the user is signed in to a Gmail account allowed to access the map. Each GMAP file is a JSON file that contains a map's URL and document ID, as well as the name of the Gmail account used to create the map.","NOTE: GMAP files were previously created by Backup and Sync from Google. Google replaced Backup and Sync with Drive for Desktop in October 2021."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/gmap_10355.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .gmap file in GitHub Atom","caption":"GMAP file open in GitHub Atom"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gmap.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
