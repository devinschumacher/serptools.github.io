These programs included WAVES+, ESPS, and the Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK).","All the above programs used audio files saved in proprietary file formats developed by Entropic Research Laboratories. SD files contain samples of human speech saved in the ESPS (Entropic Signal Processing System) format. This format was later replaced by Entropic's Esignal format.","NOTE: Microsoft purchased Entropic in 1999. As a result, Waves+ and ESPS were discontinued. However, Cambridge University continues to maintain and distribute the Hidden Markov Model Toolkit."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sd.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
