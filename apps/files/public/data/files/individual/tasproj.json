In addition to providing normal emulation features, BizHawk also includes a variety of tools that tool-assisted speedrun (TAS) creators can use to create, edit, and save speedruns.","TAStudio is one of those tools. It allows TAS creators to record, manually edit, and save speedrun inputs. In this way, TAS creators can fine-tune their speedruns, deleting extraneous inputs and streamlining characters' progress through levels.","When TAS creators save a speedrun in TAStudio, they save it as a TASPROJ file. After a TAS creator has finished editing their speedrun, they can use their TASPROJ file to play the speedrun within BizHawk."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tasproj.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
