{"slug":"conform","extension":"conform","name":"Conformalizer Change List","category":"conformalizer-change-list","summary":"","developer_org":"the-cargo-cult","developer_name":"The Cargo Cult","more_information":{"description":["Conformalizer was an audio post-production program that allowed audio producers to map audio tracks, including dialogue, music, and sound effect tracks, to a picture cut (of a film or TV show). When Conformalizer mapped audio to a picture cut, it recorded the changes it made to the audio and picture cut in a CONFORM file. Doing so allowed producers to revert to previous versions of their project's audio and picture cut if needed.","NOTE: Conformalizer was originally published by Maggot Software, before being acquired by The Cargo Cult. The Cargo Cult has since replaced Conformalizer with Matchbox."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"conform.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
