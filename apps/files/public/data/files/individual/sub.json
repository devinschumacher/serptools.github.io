Subtitles saved for use with MicroDVD videos were saved as SUB files.","SUB files are text files that contain text that controls when subtitles appear, how long they appear, and how subtitle text is formatted. For example, if the first line of a SUB file were to read {0}{90}You might not believe this, but ... , and the movie the SUB file is meant to be used with plays at 30 frames per second, the subtitle text \"You might not believe this, but ...\" will appear for the first three seconds of the movie. Lines of text can also include control codes, which specify that text should appear in certain fonts, colors, and styles.","The .SRT subtitle format is more common than the SUB format. Therefore, you might want to convert your SUB subtitles to the SRT format. SubtitleTools.com has a converter, called Convert Subtitles to Srt, that you can use to convert SUB files to the SRT format. MConverter.eu also allows users to convert SUB files to the SRT format."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/sub_683.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .sub file in GitHub Atom","caption":"SUB file open in GitHub Atom"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sub.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
