Like other STOP Djvu variants, RRBB ransomware encrypts users' files, including documents, videos, and images, and appends them with a custom extension. It then produces a ransom note named _readme.txt in every folder that contains an infected file. The ransom note lists instructions users can supposedly follow to decrypt their files.","Ransomware is most commonly distributed within programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed an unverified program, that may be how your computer became infected by RRBB ransomware.","NOTE: To learn more about STOP Djvu ransomware and its variants, refer to the .STOP entry."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"rrbb.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
