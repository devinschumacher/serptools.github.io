If a user wants to share the data they entered in TimeZero Navigator or Professional with another TimeZero user, they can export it as a TZX file.","Each TZX file contains all the routes, marks, layers, tracks, and other objects a user entered in their current TimeZero session. However, TZX files do not contain the charts upon which they were created. Therefore, before opening a TZX file, you must install the corresponding chart in TimeZero Navigator or Professional, to ensure you can view the file's data correctly.","NOTE: The TZX format replaced the .TZD format used in earlier versions of TimeZero Navigator and Professional."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tzx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
