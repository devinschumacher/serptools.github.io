This virus encrypts your files and appends the .wncry extension to them, producing files that look something like filename.docx.wncry . The encryption prevents you from opening the files.","The virus then produces a .TXT ransom note explaining what has happened to your files, as well as how you can pay a ransom to decrypt them. (FileInfo recommends you never pay a ransom to decrypt your files.)","During the encryption process, Wana Decrypt0r 2.0 produces WNCRYT files. These files are temporary files, which are eventually replaced by corresponding WNCRY files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"wncryt.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
