Discord contains a series of public and private servers organized by topic, which users can join to chat with their friends, host a virtual game night, or discuss specialized subjects.","Advanced users can create and add bots to their Discord servers. These bots perform various functions, such as automatically welcoming new members to a server, moderating content, and rewarding a server's most active members. Zbots Bots is a company that develops and sells Discord bots. The company provides a copy of the code their bots contain to their clients; the copies are saved as ZBT files.","Because ZBT files do not contain the token used to authorize a Zbots Bots Discord bot, you cannot use a ZBT file alone to host and run the bot the file describes. You can, however, copy the ZBT file's code and use it while creating your own Discord bot."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"zbt.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
