The game's Java Edition allows players to modify it using many unofficial add-ons, including custom resource packs and data packs. Resource packs add custom textures, models, music, sounds, and/or other resources to Minecraft. Data packs can add or override advancements, functions, recipes, world generation settings, and/or other data.","In Minecraft Java Edition's client.jar file, the game stores two MCASSETSROOT files it uses to identify and load its default, or vanilla, resource pack and data pack. These files can be found in the assets and data directories. Most players, however, will never encounter or need to edit these files, even when installing custom resource packs or data packs."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mcassetsroot.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
