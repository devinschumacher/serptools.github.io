This allows these applications to store and quickly load these files from your Android device's system memory, rather than its hard drive, as you use the apps.","While different Android applications create, store, and reference CNT files differently, most CNT files are stored in a cache directory or a sub-directory of that directory. For example, Facebook Messenger for Android stores cached audio files in the app's cache/​audio directory, and Twitter for Android stores cached images in the app's cache/​image_cache directory."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"cnt.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
