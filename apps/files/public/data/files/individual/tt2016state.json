Click the \"Download State\" button, choose your state, and then TurboTax will download the TT2016STATE file(s) for your state and automatically opens them. After they are opened you can fill out your state return to finish your taxes. You will most likely never see the TT2016STATE file because it is downloaded and opened automatically by the tax software.","TurboTax is available in Basic, Deluxe, Premier, and Home & Business editions. Each edition provides different features at different prices. The Basic edition requires purchase of a TurboTax state return, whereas the Deluxe, Premier, and Home & Business editions come with one TurboTax state return included. You must purchase any additional state returns."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tt2016state.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
