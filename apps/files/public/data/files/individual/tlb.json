These systems were widely used in academic, scientific, and business settings during the 1980s and 1990s for various tasks, including large-scale computations and resource management.","DEC renamed VMS/VAX to OpenVMS in 1992 and eventually discontinued the system, making TLB files obscure. However, some organizations still use OpenVMS, which also still supports TLB files.","NOTE: While VMS typically uses TLB files, applications running on the system may also use them to ensure they run correctly."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tlb.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
