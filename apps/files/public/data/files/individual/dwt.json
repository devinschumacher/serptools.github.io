By utilizing DWT files, developers only need to make an edit once and the changes will be reflected on other related pages.","The editable regions designated in a template are the areas that you want to be edited individually on webpages that won't affect other webpages generated from the template. The non-editable regions are the areas you want to remain the same on all the pages such as menus, navigation bars, logos, and footers.","You can save a webpage as a DWT template in Dreamweaver by selecting File â†’ Save as Template... . When you create the DWT file, a folder named \"Templates\" will be created in your website folder and the DWT file will be placed in it.","NOTE: Dreamweaver was originally developed by Macromedia. Adobe acquired Macromedia in 2005 and the program is now developed and distributed by Adobe."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/dwt_392.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .dwt file in Adobe Dreamweaver 2021","caption":"DWT file open in Adobe Dreamweaver 2021"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"dwt.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
