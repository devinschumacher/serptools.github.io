For example, a production engineer might use iZotope RX to remove a background hum from a TV show's dialogue track.","Projects created in iZotope RX are saved as RXDOC files. Saving a project as an RXDOC file preserves the original audio file that was imported into the project, as well as a record of all the edits a user made to that file. That way, the user can retrieve the original file or undo their edits as needed. After a user has finished editing their audio file to their satisfaction, they can export the cleaned-up audio using iZotope RX's export tools."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/rxdoc_12792.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .rxdoc file in iZotope RX 9 Audio Editor","caption":"RXDOC file open in iZotope RX 9 Audio Editor"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"rxdoc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
