{"slug":"xul","extension":"xul","name":"XML User Interface Language File","category":"xml-user-interface-language-file","summary":"","developer_org":"mozilla","developer_name":"Mozilla","more_information":{"description":["Mozilla browsers, including Firefox, support XUL to build both the main browser interface and add-ons or extensions. These files work together with other technologies like JavaScript and CSS to provide interactive and styled user experiences. Because XUL is based on XML, it is both human-readable and machine-readable, making it easier for developers to create and modify interfaces.","Users who interact with XUL files are mostly software developers and extension creators who work on customizing Mozilla-based browsers or building standalone applications that rely on the Gecko rendering engine. While most users don't directly open or edit XUL files, these files are essential for determining the software's appearance and functionality."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"xul.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
