Players can even use the program's Modify Rules feature to create their own, custom versions of solitaire. They can also use BVS Solitaire Collection's statistics- and score-tracking features to see whether their play is improving and how they stack up against other players from around the world.","When a player saves a game in BVS Solitaire Collection, the program creates a BVS file that stores the game's current state. The player can use this file to resume playing their in-progress game at a later time, return to an earlier juncture within their current game, or share their game with another BVS Solitaire Collection player.","NOTE: Players must save BVS files with the default filename assigned by BVS Solitaire Collection. Attempting to change a BVS file's default name may cause BVS Solitaire Collection to freeze."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/bvs_11743-2.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .bvs file in BVS Solitaire Collection for Mac","caption":"BVS file open in BVS Solitaire Collection for Mac"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"bvs.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
