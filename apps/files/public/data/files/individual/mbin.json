NMS Modding Station initially converts No Man's Sky's PAK files into MBIN files.","However, MBIN files are binary files, so they are not easy to edit. To edit the settings MBIN files contain, modders must use NMS Modding Station to convert their MBIN files into plain text EXML files. EXML files are XML files that can be edited in any text or source code editor.","After a modder finishes editing their EXML files, they can use NMS Modding Station to convert their EXML files back into PAK files and apply their modifications to No Man's Sky."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mbin.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
