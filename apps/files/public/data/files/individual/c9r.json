Locking the drive encrypts the stored files, using AES-256 encryption. Often, users place their Cryptomator drives in cloud storage services , so they can access the drives (and the files they contain) from multiple devices.","Files encrypted by Cryptomator use the .c9r extension, to denote they've been encrypted. These files also have encrypted filenames produced using AES-SIV encryption. Thus, a file previously named Example.rtf may have a filename like eHwTYFBFYdmnj2cVBF-hgHXjoH7sVD4ZUwpz.c9r after being encrypted by Cryptomator."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/c9r_13271.png","alt":"C9R file shown in Apple Finder","caption":"C9R file shown in Apple Finder"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"c9r.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
