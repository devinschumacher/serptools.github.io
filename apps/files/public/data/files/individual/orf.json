Casual and professional photography enthusiasts are most likely to encounter ORF files whether they own an Olympus camera or download or receive ORF images from other photographers.","Since ORF images are uncompressed, they tend to be much larger in file size than compressed image formats, such as .JPEG , .PNG , and .TIFF . Although the images are larger, they store more image data, which allows you to capture higher-quality images and more accurately adjust the white balance, contrast, sharpness, exposure, and saturation of the photographs with an image editor.","NOTE: In November 2022, Olympus was renamed to OM System."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/orf_1138.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .orf file in Adobe Photoshop 2021","caption":"ORF file open in Adobe Photoshop 2021"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"orf.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
