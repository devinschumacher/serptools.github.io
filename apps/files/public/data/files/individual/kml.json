The format eventually became a worldwide standard for geographic annotation and visualization in 2D and 3D geographic mapping programs. KML files are primarily associated with the Google Earth web application and Google Earth Pro desktop program. They are also supported by other mapping applications, such as Blue Marble Geographics Global Mapper and ESRI ArcGIS Pro.","Most KML files are created with Google Earth or Google Earth Pro. To create a KML file in Google Earth, click the \"Projects\" icon in the left pane, select \"Create,\" and choose \"Create KML file.\" To create a KML file in Google Earth Pro, select File → Save → Save Place As... , then choose \"Kml\" from the dropdown menu.","Since KML files are saved in plain text, users may create KML files from scratch or by copying features from Google Earth Pro. To do this, right-click a feature in the 3D Viewer of Google Earth Pro and select Copy , then paste it into a TXT file open in a text editor. Users can then save .TXT files, and change the .txt file extension to .kml .","NOTE: Users may save KML files as .KMZ files, which are Zip-compressed to save space when sharing the files with other users."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/kml_685.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .kml file in Google Earth Pro 7.3","caption":"KML file open in Google Earth Pro 7.3"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"kml.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
