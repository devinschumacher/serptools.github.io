For example, an analyst at a government agency may use Analyst's Notebook to investigate a suspected case of tax fraud, in hopes of bringing a criminal to justice.","In Analyst's Notebook, users conduct analyses by importing or entering relevant information and then either manually or programmatically finding connections between those pieces of information. Analyst's Notebook displays these networks of information to users as diagrams, referred to as analytical charts.","When a user wants to save an in-progress chart, they can do so by saving the chart as an ANB file. The ANB file contains all data displayed on the chart, including entered information, links, properties, labels, and legends."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"anb.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
