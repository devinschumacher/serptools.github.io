In Zyzzyva's Quiz mode, wordsmiths can create and take quizzes in which they must recall words that match specific criteria. For example, a user can create a quiz in which they must recall all six letter words that include the letters Z and X.","If a user plans to take a quiz multiple times, they can save that quiz as a ZZQ file. To do so, the user selects Save Quiz from either the New Quiz or Quiz screen. They can then load and take the quiz in Zyzzyva at any time. They can also share the quiz with other Zyzzyva users."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/zzq_12892.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .zzq file in NASPA Zyzzyva","caption":"ZZQ file open in NASPA Zyzzyva"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/zzq_12892-2.png","alt":"ZZQ file open in Apple TextEdit","caption":"ZZQ file open in Apple TextEdit"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"zzq.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
