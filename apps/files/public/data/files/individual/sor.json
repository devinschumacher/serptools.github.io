The instrument then measures the strength of the return pulses, which are known as \"traces.\" The data is then transferred to a computer and stored in a SOR file, which can be viewed and analyzed by various programs, such as VeEX Fiberizer Desktop and VIAVI FiberTrace.","NOTE: There are two versions of SOR files. The earlier version was developed by Bellcore and the newer version was developed by Telcordia."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sor.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
