It is available as a downloadable desktop version for Windows and macOS and as a web version (TurboTax Online).","However, only the macOS desktop version of TurboTax comes packaged with 3PE files. The Windows version is packaged with .1PH and .1PE files that store the forms.","You can find 3PE files in the TurboTax application package in macOS. To access the 3PE files packaged with TurboTax, right-click the application, select Show Package Contents , then navigate to the Contents/​Resources/​Forms directory.","NOTE: The macOS desktop version of TurboTax saves each 3PE file along with a nearly identical .3ME file inside the application package. When a TurboTax update is run, old 3PE and 3ME files are automatically moved to the Trash. Since these files have been replaced with newer versions, they may safely be deleted."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/3pe_4578.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .3pe file in Intuit TurboTax 2023","caption":"3PE file open in Intuit TurboTax 2023"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"3pe.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
