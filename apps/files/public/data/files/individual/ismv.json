The format allows for encryption and DRM protection.","Smooth Streaming enables streaming over the HTTP protocol with negotiation of variable transfer rates. Therefore, IIS servers can host multiple ISMV files, each at a different video quality level. Depending on the current bit rate, Smooth Streaming picks the optimal ISMV file and extracts the video fragment for the particular time to achieve the best video quality.","NOTE: ISMV files can be encoded using the paid version of Microsoft Expression Encoder."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ismv.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
