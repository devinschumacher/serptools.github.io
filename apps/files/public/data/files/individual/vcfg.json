Games created with Source 2 include VCFG scripts, which typically configure certain game settings at startup.","While most players will never need to access or modify a game's VCFG files, modders enjoy using them to customize Source 2 games. For example, a Dota 2 Reborn player might create a script that allows them to quickly toggle their camera between runes, and then add a directive to execute that script in Dota 2 Reborn's game_convars.vcfg file. Or, a player may create an entirely new VCFG script and execute that script using Dota 2's Console.","NOTE: Source 1 engine games and some Source 2 engine games also use configuration files saved with the .cfg extension."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vcfg.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
