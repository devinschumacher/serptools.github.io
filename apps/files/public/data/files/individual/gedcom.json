GEDCOM was designed to be a universal format that genealogical researchers could use to save and exchange data across genealogy databases and programs.","Since its initial release, the format has undergone several revisions, the most notable being 5.5.1. This version of the format was released in 1999 and is the most widely-used version. In 2021, FamilySearch, a software company affiliated with The LDS Church, released version 7.0 of GEDCOM, which included support for .GDZ files.","Both professional and amateur genealogists save their records in the GEDCOM format. Professionals typically create and save data used for academic purposes, while amateurs typically document their own family history.","NOTE: GEDCOM files may also be saved as .GED files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gedcom.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
