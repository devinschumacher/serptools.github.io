{"slug":"xmwx","extension":"xmwx","name":"SofTest Working Exam File","category":"softest-working-exam-file","summary":"","developer_org":"examsoft","developer_name":"ExamSoft","more_information":{"description":["ExamSoft is a digital assessment platform that schools, businesses, and other entities use to test students, employees, and those seeking certifications. It is often used in K-12, undergrad, medical, and law programs. To take an ExamSoft exam, exam takers must download and install ExamSoft SofTest, which is a Windows and macOS application, and then open an exam file. SofTest exam files are saved as XMZX files.","After an exam taker starts an exam, the exam's XMZX file is replaced by an XMWX file. This file contains a constantly-updated copy of the in-progress exam. XMWX files are resaved every 60 seconds.","When an exam taker finishes an exam, the XMWX file is converted to an XMDX file, and the XMDX file is automatically uploaded to ExamSoft's cloud servers. If you need to manually upload an XMDX file to ExamSoft's servers (for example, because you were not connected to the Internet when you finished your exam), you can find the file in SofTest's Answers directory."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"xmwx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
