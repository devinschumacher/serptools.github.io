If a user wants to save a record of the messages they've sent and received through Verizon Messages, they can do so by tapping a conversation, selecting the messages they want to save, and selecting the Download icon. This will create a VZM file that contains a record of the selected messages.","Most often, VZM files are used as message backup files. For example, a user who is switching phones may use their VZM file to restore their previous messages in a new instance of Verizon Messages."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vzm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
