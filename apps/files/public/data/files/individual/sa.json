On those phones, users can choose to hide files, such as pictures, videos, and documents, that would otherwise appear in the phone's default Explorer app. This prevents others from finding and opening the hidden files.","To hide a file, users open the file from Explorer and then select More → Hide . The user's phone then encrypts the file, changes its extension to .sa , and moves it to the phone's Gallery/​cloud/​.secretAlbum directory. The first time a user hides a file, they must create one or more passwords. Users cannot access their hidden files without providing these password(s)."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sa.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
