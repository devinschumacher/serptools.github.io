However, the Telecommunication Standardization Sector of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) superseded the CCITT. The A-Law format is one version of the G.711 audio codec , with the other being Mu-Law, also written as Âµ-Law.","Much of the world, including Europe, uses the A-Law compression algorithm in 8-bit pulse code modulation (PCM) digital communications, most notably voice transmission via telephones. However, North America and Japan use Mu-Law.","The A-Law and Mu-Law compression algorithms are similar. They offer 2:1 bit compression and optimize the dynamic range of an analog audio signal for digitization. However, they provide different coding levels and bit inversion. Also, A-Law compression is used in place of Mu-Law for international calls between two countries (where one country already is using A-Law) because it provides a smaller dynamic range with less distortion.","NOTE: AL files may also use the .alaw file extension ( .ALAW files)."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"al.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
