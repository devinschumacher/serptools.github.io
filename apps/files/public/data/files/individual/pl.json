Plain text editors, including Microsoft Notepad and Apple TextEdit, may also open and modify PL files. However, source code editors provide more helpful viewing and editing features for the Perl scripting language that are not available with plain text editors.","NOTE: PL files typically start with the line #!/usr/local/bin/perl , which tells the computer to run the script using the installed Perl interpreter."],"screenshot":{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/pl_77.png","srcset":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/md/pl_77.png 760w, https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/pl_77.png 380w","alt":"Screenshot of a .pl file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code 1","width":"380","height":"253","caption":"PL file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code 1"}},"scraped_at":"2025-08-09T21:58:55.066733","source":{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/extension/pl","file":"pl.html"}}
