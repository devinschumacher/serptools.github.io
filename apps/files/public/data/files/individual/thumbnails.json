However, you need to verify that your system displays system and hidden files in the settings.","The more images you have in the Gallery app, the larger the THUMBDATA3--1967290299 and THUMBDATA3-1763508120 files grow. They may become several hundred MBs, or in some cases, several GBs in size if you have a large number of thumbnail images in your Gallery app. The file increases in size every time a new image is added and even when an image is deleted the indexed properties of the image still remain.","To reduce the THUMBDATA3--1967290299 and THUMBDATA3-1763508120 file sizes, you need to remove images from the Gallery app then delete the THUMBDATA3--1967290299 and THUMBDATA3-1763508120 files. The files will be regenerated by the Gallery app but only for the images currently stored in the app."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"thumbnails.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
