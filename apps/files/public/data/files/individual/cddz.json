The CDDZ format is the default format for saving diagrams ( File â†’ Save ), and once you save a CDDZ file, you can close it and then re-open it for further editing.","Besides drawing and settings information, CDDZ files may also contain program code written in a scripting language called ConceptDraw Basic, which allows users to manipulate drawing objects automatically. The code is commonly used to automate repetitive tasks.","NOTE: CS Odessa introduced the CDDZ format when it released version 10 of CS Odessa ConceptDraw PRO, then changed the name of the software to ConceptDraw DIAGRAM. Version 9 and earlier of CS Odessa ConceptDraw PRO uses the .CDD file format to save documents."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/cddz_9835.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .cddz file in CS Odessa ConceptDraw DIAGRAM 16","caption":"CDDZ file open in CS Odessa ConceptDraw DIAGRAM 16"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"cddz.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
