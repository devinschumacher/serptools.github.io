Enabling the system allows the player to receive special Mystery Gifts at official Nintendo events. These Mystery Gifts are saved as WC3 files.","Enterprising Pokémon players have uploaded the WC3 files available for FireRed, LeafGreen, and Emerald to the Internet and created tools that allow players to inject these files into their saved games.
