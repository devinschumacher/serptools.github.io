First create a plain text document, such as a .TXT file, with the correct DSL formatting and then rename the file extension to \".dsl.\" You can then use the DSL Compiler that is included with the Lingvo Dictionary application. If you choose \"Create error log file (*.dde)\" before you compile, a DDE file will be created that will notify you of any errors that were detected in your dictionary. The DDE file will be named after your DSL file.","NOTE: ABBYY no longer develops Lingvo Dictionary software."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"dde.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
