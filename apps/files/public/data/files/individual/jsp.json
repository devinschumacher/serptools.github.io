Developers write these webpages using Java code, as well as HTML and XML syntax.","JSP files typically contain only Java and HTML content. Any web server that includes a JSP-compatible servlet container, such as Apache Tomcat or Jetty, can render a JSP file as a webpage in users' web browsers.","However, were a user to view a processed JSP webpage's source code in their browser, the user would see only HTML code. When a web server processes a JSP file, it dynamically translates the Java code the file contains into HTML. The user's web browser then renders this fully-HTML version of the webpage.","NOTE: JSP files were formerly known as JavaServer Pages. The Eclipse Foundation rebranded Java Enterprise Edition as Jakarta Enterprise Edition in 2018."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/jsp_225.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .jsp file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"JSP file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"jsp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
