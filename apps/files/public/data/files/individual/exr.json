In addition to the format, the company released an open-source software library that could create, edit, and process OpenEXR images, which use the .exr file extension.","The ASWF took over the development of OpenEXR in 2019 and periodically releases updates. Many major studios, including Walt Disney Animation Studios, Weta Digital, Pixar Animation Studios, and DreamWorks, also contribute to the format's development.","Computer graphics professionals, such as visual effects artists and animators, commonly use the OpenEXR format because of its compositing features and accurate HDR scene-linear image data representation. Other notable OpenEXR features include multiple channels of different pixel sizes and different points of view for the same image."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/exr_5332-2.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .exr file in Apple Preview 11","caption":"EXR file open in Apple Preview 11"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"exr.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
