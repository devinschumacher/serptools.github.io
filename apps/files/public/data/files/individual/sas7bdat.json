It allows analysts to create statistical models, perform multivariate analysis, graph and present data, and engage in predictive analytics.","In SAS version 7, the suite began saving users' datasets as SAS7BDAT files. These files are binary database files that contain a header and data pages. The header lists the database's ID, name, contents, and other metadata . The data pages contain subheaders that include additional metadata and the packed binary data that represents the database's dataset.","NOTE: SAS7BDAT files created on different platforms use slightly different file formats.
