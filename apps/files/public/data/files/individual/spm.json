Because SuperTuxKart is an open-source project, players can download, examine, and modify the game's source code . Among other things, SuperTuxKart's source code contains 3D models used to show karts, racetracks, and other objects in-game. These models are saved as SPM files.","SPM files comprise only a portion of an in-game object. To show a finalized object, SPM files are combined with PNG files that contain textures (or skins) and XML files that detail how SuperTuxKart applies those textures. If a player wants to modify a SuperTuxKart object's appearance (e.g. they want to add larger wheels to a kart), they can do so by opening and editing the object's SPM and PNG files (and if necessary, its XML file)."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"spm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
