The KSP community has created many mods for the game, which allow players to alter the game's gameplay.","Some KSP mods are compatible with only certain versions of the game. To help players manage their mods and KSP installations, KSP Add-on Version Checker (KSP-AVC) uses VERSION files to check that a mod is compatible with a player's version of KSP. KSP-AVC and other mod managers can also use VERSION files to retrieve, install, and update mods from the download locations listed in the files."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/version_12919.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .version file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"VERSION file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"version.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
