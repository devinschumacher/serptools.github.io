Hamamatsu NanoZoomer saves slide images in the VMS, .VMU , and .NDPI formats. The VMS format packages a single slide image as at least two JPEGs. One JPEG contains a high-resolution copy of the slide, and the other contains a lower-resolution copy. If the high-resolution image would be larger than 65,535 pixels on one side, NanoZoomer instead saves the high-resolution image as multiple JPEGs, which slide-viewing software automatically combines into one image.","In addition to JPEG files, VMS files contain plain text index and optimization files. These files contain metadata that slide-viewing applications use to show slide images correctly."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vms.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
