{"slug":"ada","extension":"ada","name":"Ada Source Code","category":"ada-source-code","summary":"","developer_org":"jean-ichbiah-and-cii-honeywell-bull","developer_name":"Jean Ichbiah and CII Honeywell Bull","more_information":{"description":["CII Honeywell Bull developed the Ada programming language in response to a request from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). In the 1970s, the DoD realized the programs its embedded computer systems used were written in hundreds of different programming languages. To reduce this number, the DoD commissioned several companies to create a standard, secure programming language that could be used to develop most DoD programs. By the end of this process, Ada became the DoD's default programming language.","Typically, programs written in Ada consist of an ADB file, which stores the program's body, and an ADS file, which stores the programs package specifications, or \"specs.\" However, developers sometimes save Ada source code in ADA files. For example, if a developer is importing Ada source code into another program, they may save that code as an ADA file and manually specify whether the file is a body file or a specs file.","Because Ada contains many safety- and security-related features, it is used to develop programs for not only the defense industry, but also the transportation, space, and financial industries. Therefore, ADA files may contain programs written for use in any of these industries."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ada.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
