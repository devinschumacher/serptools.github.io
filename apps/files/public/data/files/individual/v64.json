The device saved users' game data files as V64 files. Each V64 file contained an exact copy of the N64 game it was created from, as well as a copy of a player's save data. Players could export V64 files from and load V64 files into Doctor V64.","The game data V64 files contain is byteswapped, meaning it is recorded in neither the big-endian or little-endian format. Non-byteswapped N64 ROMs are typically saved using the .Z64 extension."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"v64.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
