For example, if a professional videographer wanted to add a watermark to a large set of videos, they could load the videos in ImBatch, create a task to add the watermark, and then run the task to automatically add the watermark to all their videos.","If a VidBatch user knows they'll want to run a set of tasks on additional videos in the future, they can save their current task list as a VBT file. The user can then load and run the VBT file while processing other videos. For example, if the videographer referenced above knew they wanted to apply their watermark to additional videos in the future, they could save their watermarking task as a VBT file. Then, they could load and run the file whenever they process videos in VidBatch, to quickly add their watermark.","NOTE: VBT files are plain text files that contain a VidBatch task list formatted using XML. If you do not have access to VidBatch but want to view the task list a VBT file contains, you can open the file in any text editor."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/vbt_12256.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .vbt file in High Motion Software VidBatch","caption":"VBT file open in High Motion Software VidBatch"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vbt.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
