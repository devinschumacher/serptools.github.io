They can be exported to a variety of video file formats or burned to DVDs and Blu-ray discs for sharing with others.","NOTE: DMSM files are not suitable for sharing with other users since they contain references to video and audio files, but not the files themselves. If you want to share a DMSM project for someone else to edit, you must also share all referenced multimedia files, which must be organized using the same directory structure."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"dmsm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
