These custom languages are often variants of existing languages, which borrow concepts from other languages or include slight tweaks to an existing language's functions.","One way developers describe their custom languages to others is by creating a CLANG file. The CLANG file lists the functions, constructors, and other code the developer's language uses. It may also include comments explaining the developer's language and additional example code."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"clang.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
