The files are located inside the \"glyphs\" folder in the UFO file. GLIF files typically are not removed from UFO files and are accessed when a program opens the UFO file, such as FontForge, RoboFont, or Glyphs. However, since GLIF files are saved in an XML format, they can be opened by a plain text editor."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"glif.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
