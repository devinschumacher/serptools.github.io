In Alice, students drag and drop characters, objects, and code snippets to produce 3D animations. A student can edit their animation in either Alice's Scene Editor, which allows the student to add and manipulate objects, or Code Editor, which allows the student to animate objects.","Alice 3 saves students' animation projects as A3P files. From within Alice 3, students can export the animation their A3P file contains as an .A3W file, which is a Zip archive that contains all the animation's assets. Students can use their A3W file to play their animation in the Alice Player, a standalone Alice animation player.","NOTE: A3P files are not compatible with previous versions of Alice, and animation projects created in previous versions of Alice are not compatible with Alice 3."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/a3p_12346.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .a3p file in Alice 3","caption":"A3P file open in Alice 3"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"a3p.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
