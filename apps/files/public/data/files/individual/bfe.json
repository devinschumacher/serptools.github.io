{"slug":"bfe","extension":"bfe","name":"Bcrypt Encrypted File","category":"bcrypt-encrypted-file","summary":"","developer_org":"johnny-shelley","developer_name":"Johnny Shelley","more_information":{"description":["Bcrypt is a cross-platform file encryption utility that is most popularly used by Linux users. After installing bcrypt, users can enter bcrypt [-orc] [-sn] and a filename in a terminal window to encrypt that file. As part of encrypting the file, users must enter a passphrase. Bcrypt then produces an encrypted copy of the file, saved with the .bfe extension. By default, bcrypt also deletes the original file, though users can disable this feature.","BFE files are encrypted using a variation of the Blowfish cipher, which is a symmetric-key block cipher created in 1993. As such, the key used to encrypt a BFE file is also the key used to decrypt it. Each BFE file contains the key used to decrypt it, hashed to a 448-bit value."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"bfe.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
