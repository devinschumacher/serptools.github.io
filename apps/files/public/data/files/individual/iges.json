The standard was initially utilized for the manufacturing of aerospace-related parts. However, it spread to other industries, such as automotive and machinery, after ICAM released the first official version of IGES in 1980. Data files stored in the IGES standard may be saved as IGES files but are more commonly saved as .IGS files.","Although the IGES standard is still used today, it has significantly decreased in usage since the late-1990s. This is due to the release of more efficient formats, like .STEP and Parasolid, and lack of development (the last official IGES version was released in 1996)."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/iges_395.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .iges file in CADEX CAD Exchanger 3.7","caption":"IGES file open in CADEX CAD Exchanger 3.7"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"iges.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
