Ulead released version 3 of PhotoImpact in 1996.","In PhotoImpact version 3, users could save an album of edited images as an AB3 file. However, these files do not contain the images themselves, but only information used to load the images. Thus, if you move an image referenced in an AB3 file, PhotoImpact will not be able to load that image when loading the AB3 file."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ab3.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
