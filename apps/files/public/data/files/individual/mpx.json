For example, you may use Project to manage your home renovation or the moving parts of a corporate merger.","The software saves projects in the proprietary MPP format by default to store project information. Since not many applications support the MPP format, Microsoft developed the MPX format to make it easier for users to exchange project information with other apps.","Microsoft Project can export MPX files along with several other third-party programs.
