The FZ series included the FZ-1, FZ-10M, and FZ-20M keyboards. The Hohner HS-1 is a rebranded FZ-1.","FZ series users who want to modify the sounds their keyboard contains can do using FZDUMP. FZDUMP allows users to extract sounds from or send sounds to FZ series keyboards. When a user chooses to extract all the sounds from their keyboard, FZDUMP saves the resulting collection as an FZF file. In contrast, .FZB files contain a single sound bank, and .FZV files contain a single sound. At most, an FZF file can contain 64 sounds, as that is the maximum number of sounds an FZ series keyboard can store."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/fzf_1752.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .fzf file in FMJ-Software Awave Studio","caption":"FZF file open in FMJ-Software Awave Studio"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"fzf.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
