You will most likely encounter an IGS file only if you work with CAD software in a field that involves manufacturing, such as the automotive or aerospace industries.","The Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing (ICAM) United States Air Force department developed the IGES format in 1980. Many CAD programs subsequently adopted it, and it became a standard. However, in the mid-1990s, the STEP ( .STP ) format replaced the IGES format, and the usage of IGS files eventually declined.","NOTE: IGS files may also be saved with the .iges file extension ( .IGES files)."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/igs_780.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .igs file in CADEX CAD Exchanger 3.7","caption":"IGS file open in CADEX CAD Exchanger 3.7"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/igs_7966.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .igs file in Glare Technologies Indigo Renderer 4","caption":"IGS file open in Glare Technologies Indigo Renderer 4"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/igs_7966-2.png","alt":"IGS file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"IGS file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"igs.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
