These tasks don't have deadlines or specific time frames like most other items in calendars. The app is commonly used for keeping class attendance, helping kids handle chores, and keep track of friends and when you last visited them. The CONSIS file is the main file used by Sciral Consistency and when opened appears as a spreadsheet with tasks making up the rows and calendar dates making up the columns."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"consis.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
