Players can create new or load existing worlds on Terraria's Select World screen. When a player creates a new world, they specify the world's name, seed, size, and game type. Terraria then saves the player's world in a WLD file.","The PC versions of Terraria store WLD files in the following directories:","Players can load WLD files when playing Terraria in single-player or multiplayer mode. For example, when a player hosts a multiplayer game, they can host that game using one of their existing WLD files (by selecting it from the Select World screen during the setup process).","NOTE: Terraria also saves backups of players' WLD files. These .BAK files use the .wld.bak extension and are saved in the same directory as WLD files."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/wld_6537.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .wld file in Re-Logic Terraria","caption":"WLD file open in Re-Logic Terraria"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/wld_6537-2.png","alt":"WLD file open in TerraMap","caption":"WLD file open in TerraMap"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"wld.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
