When you create a virtual machine with the software, it creates a .PVM file (or a .MACVM file on Apple silicon Macs), which is a macOS package that stores all of the files required to run the VM.","One of the files created by Parallels Desktop for Mac and stored in the .PVM file is the HDD file. The HDD file functions similarly to Windows C:\\â€‹ drive.","To view your HDD file, locate your PVM file, right-click it, and choose Show Package Contents . The HDD file is typically named after the operating system. For example, the HDD file for Windows 11 may be named Windows 11-0.hdd .","NOTE: HDD files from version 2 of Parallels Desktop can be opened in Oracle VM VirtualBox. Other versions' HDD files cannot be opened in VirtualBox."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/hdd_3272.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .hdd file in macOS Finder","caption":"HDD file open in macOS Finder"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"hdd.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
