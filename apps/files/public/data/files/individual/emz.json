Microsoft then replaced the WMF format with the Enhanced Windows Metafile (EMF) format, which is a 32-bit format that is device-independent.","Microsoft developed the EMZ compression format to reduce the size of EMF files to save storage space and more easily transfer EMF graphics between applications, particularly Microsoft Visio and the Office suite, which includes Word and PowerPoint. While EMF files are common and various image editors may export them, EMZ files are much less common."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/emz_913.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .emz file in Microsoft PowerPoint 365","caption":"EMZ file open in Microsoft PowerPoint 365"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"emz.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
