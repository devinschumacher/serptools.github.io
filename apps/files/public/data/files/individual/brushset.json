These effects are grouped into brush sets, which commonly contain related brushes. For example, by default, Procreate's Brush Library contains Sketching, Inking, Drawing, and Painting brush sets (as well as many others). These brush sets, and users' custom brush sets, can be exported as BRUSHSET files, to be shared with other users.","To export a Procreate brush set as a BRUSHSET file, tap that brush set.
