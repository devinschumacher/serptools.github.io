Those videos, which are available to be played back for up to 48 hours, are saved locally as a set of EXO files.","Each EXO file contains a compressed , encrypted segment of the downloaded video. For example, a 10-minute video may be saved as a set of 30 EXO files. YouTube for Android encrypts EXO files to prevent users from sharing them with others. When you play a downloaded video in YouTube for Android, the app automatically pieces together the related EXO files and plays them in the correct order."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"exo.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
