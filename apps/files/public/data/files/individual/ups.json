It supports any file size (it is not limited to 16MB like the IPS format), as well as bi-directional patching, which means that the same patch can patch and unlatch a game. The format also uses CRC32 checksums to guarantee patches are not applied to incorrect games and to maintain integrity."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ups.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
