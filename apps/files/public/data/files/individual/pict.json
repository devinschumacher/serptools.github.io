This vector image format is native to Macintosh computers and was used by Mac OS's QuickDraw graphics library and API .","The first version of the PICT format, known as PICT 1, supports up to eight colors. The second version, known as PICT 2, supports 24- and 32-bit color, allowing images to include millions of colors.","Both versions of the PICT format have since been deprecated and largely replaced by the .PDF format. PICT files may also be saved with the .PCT extension."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/pict_337.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .pict file in XnViewMP","caption":"PICT file open in XnViewMP"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pict.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
