These devices were precursors to smartphones, often included touchscreens and styluses, and were used for tasks like email, calendar management, mobile web browsing, and media playback.","Users could download TSK files from theme websites or create their own using tools like Microsoft’s Theme Generator. They would then transfer the TSK file to their PDA (likely via ActiveSync or a memory card) and select the theme from the “Today” settings screen to alter the device’s home screen and overall interface appearance."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tsk.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
