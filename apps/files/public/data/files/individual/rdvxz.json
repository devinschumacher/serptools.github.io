Infrasound Recorder records this audio using your smartphone's microphone and, if available, barometer. The app saves recorded audio as RDVXZ files.","On Android devices, Infrasound Recorder stores RDVXZ files in a folder named RDVXZ . If users want to analyze the audio their RDVXZ files contain on their PC, they can do so by copying the files to their computer."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"rdvxz.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
