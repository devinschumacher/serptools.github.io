After creating an assembly, users can translate it (or its components) into a 2D drawing.","When a user creates a drawing, they are asked to choose a drawing sheet format. This format determines the drawing's width and height, as well as what guidelines, logos, and notation the drawing includes. SolidWorks contains many default drawing sheet formats, most of which represent a standard format used in the engineering industry. These drawing sheet formats are saved as SLDDRT files."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/slddrt_3395.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .slddrt file in Dassault Systemes SolidWorks Premium 2022","caption":"SLDDRT file open in Dassault Systemes SolidWorks Premium 2022"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"slddrt.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
