In this manner, a viewer can see a 3D effect from the 2D images when viewing the image in one of three ways: Cross-eye View : The viewer looks at the static side-by side image using a \"cross-eye\" stare Anaglyph View : The two images are overlaid on each other and the viewer wears 3D glasses. 3D Rendering : An application renders the 2D images into a resulting 3D image. NOTE: JPS files can be saved by stereo cameras, which have two or more lenses."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"jps.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
