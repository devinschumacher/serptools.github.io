This allowed gamers to continue playing a game even if they lost their game cartridge or the game became corrupted. These days, most SMC files are stored on and downloaded from emulator-related websites, which provide retro gamers with the ability to play Super Nintendo games on their PCs.","SMC files are related to .SFC files, which are also Super Nintendo ROMs. SFC files are saved in the file format used by the Super Famicom, which is the original, Japanese version of the Super Nintendo system. Most SNES emulators that can open SMC files can also open SFC files."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/smc_11469.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .smc file in Solibri Office 9","caption":"SMC file open in Solibri Office 9"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"smc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
