Video game developers such as Infogrames and THQ used 4X's 4X Movie application to compress their games' cutscenes into reasonably-sized video files that did not take up too much disk space. Developers could also include multiple languages' worth of audio tracks within a 4XM file.","In 2002, 4X Technologies founded its own video game development studio, called 4X Studio. Ironically, 4X Studio did not use 4XM files in its own video games."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/4xm_11611.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .4xm file in VLC media player","caption":"4XM file open in VLC media player"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"4xm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
