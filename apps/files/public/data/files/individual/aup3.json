AUP3 replaces the .AUP format, used by previous versions of Audacity. You can still open AUP files in Audacity 3, but the program saves all projects, even those previously saved as AUP files, as AUP3 files.","Unlike AUP files, which are XML files that contain references to audio files and other data, AUP3 files are database files that contain the audio and other data a project uses. Because AUP3 files include all of a project's data, you can no longer \"break\" a project by moving audio files or other data referenced by the project. However, because AUP3 files contain audio tracks, they can be very large (several gigabytes) and may load more slowly than AUP files."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/aup3_11971-2.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .aup3 file in Audacity 3.2","caption":"AUP3 file open in Audacity 3.2"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"aup3.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
