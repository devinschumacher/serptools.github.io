{"slug":"ffe","extension":"ffe","name":"DirectInput Force Feedback Effect","category":"directinput-force-feedback-effect","summary":"","developer_org":"microsoft","developer_name":"Microsoft","more_information":{"description":["Microsoft DirectX is a collection of APIs that perform tasks related to multimedia, especially video games. DirectInput is one of DirectX's component APIs. DirectInput allows developers to code haptic feedback, such as constant force, increasing force, and vibrations, into their video games. When an associated in-game action occurs, DirectInput translates these effects into actual physical forces output through a player's joystick or controller.","Files used to store DirectInput force effects are saved using the .ffe extension. Typically, developers reference FFE files as part of DirectInput-related game code. Specifically, developers include FFE files in directives used to load haptic effects onto players' devices, so the effects can be played during a game. The DirectX SDK includes many sample FFE files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ffe.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
