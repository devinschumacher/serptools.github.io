{"slug":"fdmdownload","extension":"fdmdownload","name":"Free Download Manager Partially Downloaded File","category":"free-download-manager-partially-downloaded-file","summary":"","developer_org":"freedownloadmanager.org","developer_name":"FreeDownloadManager.ORG","more_information":{"description":["You will only encounter an FDMDOWNLOAD file if you use Free Download Manager to download files over the Internet. When you start downloading a file, Free Download Manager creates a placeholder FDMDOWNLOAD file in your computer's Downloads folder. The file typically has the .fdmdownload extension appended to the download's actual filename.","When your download finishes, Free Download Manager will replace its FDMDOWNLOAD file with your actual downloaded file. You will see an FDMDOWNLOAD file in your Downloads folder only when a file is currently downloading or when a download was interrupted before completion (e.g. you closed Free Download Manager, paused the download, or your Internet went out).","NOTE: FDMDOWNLOAD files may appear with incorrectly-listed file sizes. For example, an FDMDOWNLOAD file that contains only 2GB of data may be listed with a file size of 4GB, because that is the expected file size of the yet-to-be-completed download."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"fdmdownload.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
