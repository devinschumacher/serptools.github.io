Initially, users create and save their models as plain text PROTOTXT files. After a user trains and refines their model using Caffe, the program saves the user's trained model as a CAFFEMODEL file.","CAFFEMODEL files are binary protocol buffer files. As such, you cannot open, examine, and edit them in a source code editor, as you would PROTOTXT files. CAFFEMODEL files are meant to be integrated into applications that can utilize trained image classification and image segmentation models, using Caffe."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"caffemodel.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
