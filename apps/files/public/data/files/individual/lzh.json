The LZH acronym comes from the names of the inventors Lempel-Ziv and Haruyasu.","LZH compression is most commonly used in Japan but is supported by a variety of compression and decompression utilities, such as Corel WinZip, WinRAR, and 7-Zip. You are most likely to encounter LZH files if you use a compression utility that supports the format and compress your files with the LZH scheme. However, you may also receive an LZH archive from a co-worker or friend via email or cloud storage space that is looking to share one or more large files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"lzh.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
