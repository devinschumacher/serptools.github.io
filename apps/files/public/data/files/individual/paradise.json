{"slug":"paradise","extension":"paradise","name":"Paradise Ransomware Encrypted File","category":"paradise-ransomware-encrypted-file","summary":"","developer_org":"n-a","developer_name":"N/A","more_information":{"description":["In September 2017, BleepingComputer.com user gschuck reported that their client's computer had been infected by a new form of ransomware called Paradise. This ransomware uses RSA encryption to encrypt users' files, appends the .paradise extension to each affected file, and generates a file named #DECRYPTMYFILES#.txt or ---==$$$OPEN_ME_UP$$$==---.txt in each folder containing an affected file. The TXT files contain instructions a user is supposed to follow to pay a ransom and receive a key they can use to decrypt their files. (You should never pay a ransom to decrypt your files.)","However, users do not need to pay a ransom to decrypt most files encrypted by Paradise ransomware. In October 2019, anti-malware company Emsisoft developed a Paradise decryption tool any Windows user can use to decrypt Paradise-infected files for free. In addition to being able to decrypt files appended with the .paradise extension, Emsisoft Decryptor for Paradise can decrypt PARADISE files appended with the .2k19sys , .p3rf0rm4 , .exploit , .immortal , .FC , and other extensions.","Typically, Paradise is distributed via phishing emails that contain malicious .ZIP , .IQY , or other attachments. Opening these attachments executes a PowerShell command that installs Paradise on your computer.","While Paradise is now an old form of ransomware, it is still used regularly. For example, in early 2020, users reported a new spam campaign that used emails pretending to be free offers, order receipts, and software keys to distribute Paradise using IQY attachments."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"paradise.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
