PHD files may be saved in a text or a binary format. However, the binary format is much smaller in file size. To specify the text format, set the IBM_JAVA_HEAPDUMP_TEXT=true environment variable.","NOTE: Portable heap dumps are typically generated by killing a running Java application. Therefore, to create a PHD file, start your Java program with the required environment variables set and then kill it."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"phd.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
