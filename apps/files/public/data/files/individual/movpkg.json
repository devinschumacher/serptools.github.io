{"slug":"movpkg","extension":"movpkg","name":"High-Resolution Lossless Media File","category":"high-resolution-lossless-media-file","summary":"","developer_org":"apple","developer_name":"Apple","more_information":{"description":["Apple Music and TV allow users to download high-resolution, losslessly compressed versions of audio and video files. These songs, movies, and TV episodes are saved as MOVPKG files. They are downloaded using Apple's HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) adaptive bitrate streaming protocol. This is why, in some instances, forum users may refer to MOVPKG files as HLS files or streams.","Each MOVPKG file contains a series of FRAG files. These files are audio or video segments that contain a portion of the data that makes up a song or video. Each MOVPKG file also contains multiple XML files and an M3U8 file, which define the order in which a MOVPKG's FRAG files should be played, as well as other metadata .","NOTE: Only Apple Music subscribers can download music in MOVPKG format. Non-subscribers cannot download music as MOVPKG files.","Because the MOVPKG format is not widely supported, you may want to stop Apple Music and TV from downloading media as MOVPKG files. To do so, open the apps' Preferences menu and deselect any options that save media as high-resolution or high-definition files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"movpkg.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
