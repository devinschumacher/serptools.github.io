However, they may also store other types of images, such as satellite map imagery or medical scans.","The JP2 format was created in 2000 by the Joint Photographic Experts Group ( JPEG ) committee to replace the JPEG format. However, the reception of the format was minimal as the JPEG format is still overwhelmingly favored.","Most JPEG 2000 images are saved as .JP2 or .JPX files, and may also be saved as .J2K files.
