Each TTML file contains a fixed set of header and body elements used to play subtitles and specify metadata about those subtitles. For example, each TTML file includes a <styling> element that specifies its subtitles' text style and a <language> element that specifics its subtitles' language.","The actual subtitles a TTML file contains are found in its <body> section. Each line of the file's subtitles is written as a separate paragraph ( <p></p> ), with an accompanying start and end time written in HH:MM:SS:SSS format.","Because TTML is a widely-accepted format, many video players, platforms, and streaming services include support for TTML-based subtitles. For example, YouTube users can upload TTML subtitles alongside their videos."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/ttml_12531.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .ttml file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"TTML file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ttml.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
