Over the years, various developers have released many versions of RPG Maker, including RPG Maker 2000 and RPG Maker 2003.","Game development projects created by RPG Maker 2000 and RPG Maker 2003 always include an RPG_RT.lmt file. This file contains a record of the maps a project includes, the order in which those maps should be shown in the RPG Maker project editor, and other map-related data. It is stored alongside a project's .LMU map file, named MAP###.lmu , and LDB map database file, named RPG_RT.ldb .","In some cases (most often, after RPG Maker 2000 or 2003 quit accidentally due to memory overload), RPG Maker 2000 or 2003 may show a Map Tree Data is corrupted error when you open a project. This means the LMT file associated with your game project is damaged. If you have encountered this error, refer to this tutorial , which explains how to create a new LMT file for your project."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"lmt.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
