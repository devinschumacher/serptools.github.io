Suspending a VM allows you to stop a VM and deallocate it from using system resources. This is helpful because it allows you to switch between multiple VMs without overloading your system.","VMware virtualization software automatically creates and saves the VMSS file in the VM file when pausing the VM. For example, Fusion saves the VMSS file in the .VMWAREVM file, which you can find in the following location (Fusion saves it here by default):","Macintosh HD/​Users/​[username]/​Virtual Machines","When you resume a VM, the virtualization software deletes the VMSS file. Therefore, the VMSS file only exists while the VM is suspended.","NOTE: The suspended state of a VM differs from a snapshot (saved in .VMSN and .VMSD files).
