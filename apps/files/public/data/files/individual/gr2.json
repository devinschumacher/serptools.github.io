It is middleware (software that works between different applications or systems to help them work together more smoothly) that has been used in many commercial titles across PC, console, and mobile platforms.","The GR2 format is typically part of a game's build pipeline, supporting tasks like animation blending, mesh deformation, and real-time playback. Third-party 3D content creation tools may also support GR2 files, allowing for both exporting to and importing from them.","NOTE: Developers working with older Granny file formats ( .GRN ) can convert them to the GR2 format using the official \"grn2gr2\" conversion utility."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gr2.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
