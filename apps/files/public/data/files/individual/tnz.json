Originally known as Toonz, the program became open-source in 2016 and was renamed to OpenToonz.","OpenToonz saves animators' scene-creation projects as TNZ files. These files are plain text files that specify a scene's settings, included assets, and animations. By default, OpenToonz saves TNZ files in its scenes directory.","Notably, TNZ files do not contain a copy of the assets used in a scene. Instead, they contain references to where those assets are stored. If you move the assets a TNZ file references, or the TNZ file itself, you may have trouble opening the file in OpenToonz.","NOTE: OpenToonz saves backups of users' TNZ files as TNZ.BAK files. To use these files, remove .bak from their extension."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/tnz_13030.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .tnz file in Dwango OpenToonz","caption":"TNZ file open in Dwango OpenToonz"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/tnz_13030-2.png","alt":"TNZ file open in Apple TextEdit","caption":"TNZ file open in Apple TextEdit"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tnz.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
