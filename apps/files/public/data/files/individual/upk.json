Professional development studios used version 3 of Unreal Engine to develop games such as Unreal Tournament 3, Mass Effect, Mirror's Edge, and BioShock. Epic Games also published a free version of Unreal Engine 3, known as the Unreal Development Kit (UDK).","In version 3, Unreal Engine saved various types of game assets in UPK files. Developers could import UPK files into Unreal Engine 3 projects, to add the assets they contained to their game. However, version 4 of Unreal Engine no longer supports the UPK format. Instead, it saves assets in the .UASSET format."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"upk.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
