Micro-Cap is an application that electronics engineers use to model, simulate, and test electrical circuits. The most recent version of Micro-Cap, Micro-Cap 12, allows engineers to perform smoke and stress analyses, perform worst-case analyses, and adjust the temperature conditions a circuit is tested under, among other features.","Micro-Cap 12 and earlier versions save engineers' circuit models as CIR files. These files are plain text files formatted such that Micro-Cap can read and transform them into circuit diagrams. The first section of a CIR file, which contains the header [Main] , details the file's type, the version of Micro-Cap that created the file, and various other metadata . The remainder of the file contains data used to show a circuit in Micro-Cap."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/cir_11935.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .cir file in Micro-Cap 12","caption":"CIR file open in Micro-Cap 12"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"cir.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
