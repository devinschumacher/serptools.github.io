Further investigation revealed that .cadq was a new extension used by STOP ransomware, which is a commonly-distributed type of ransomware. Other variants of STOP ransomware append users' files with the .STOP , .djvu , .rumba , .radman , or .gero extensions.","Cadq ransomware is most commonly hidden within \"free programs\" available from software download websites, especially programs that claim to be free copies of paid programs. When users install the free program, they also unwittingly install the ransomware the program contains."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"cadq.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
