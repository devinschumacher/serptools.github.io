Designer was used in engineering, construction, and other related fields while Windows Draw was used in content publishing-related fields.","Micrografx was acquired by Corel in 2001 and Corel renamed Designer as DESIGNER and integrated it into CorelDRAW Technical Suite. Corel also integrated Windows Draw into CorelDRAW Graphics Suite.","You can still open DRW files with CorelDRAW software but not all formatting is supported. For example, text and shading in a drawing may be moved or removed when opened in CorelDRAW software."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"drw.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
