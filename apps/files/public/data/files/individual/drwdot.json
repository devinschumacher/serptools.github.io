Engineers can also use SolidWorks to create 2D vector drawings of a part or assembly. Those drawings are saved as DRWDOT files.","If an engineer knows they'll want to reuse the document properties associated with an existing SolidWorks drawing, they can save those properties as a DRWDOT template. Then, they can select the DRWDOT file and apply the template's properties when creating new drawings.","To create a SolidWorks drawing template:","SolidWorks will then save your DRWDOT file in the program's default template folder."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/drwdot_3394.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .drwdot file in Dassault Systemes SolidWorks Premium 2022","caption":"DRWDOT file open in Dassault Systemes SolidWorks Premium 2022"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"drwdot.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
