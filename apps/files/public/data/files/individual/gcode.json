This process involves breaking down a 3D model into many thin layers. Each layer has its own set of instructions, which are compiled into a GCODE file. The 3D printer reads this file, layer by layer, to build the final object with precision.","G-code is a widely used language in 3D printing, and its name comes from the fact that most commands start with the letter \"G,\" which stands for \"Geometry.\" Before 3D printing became widespread, G-code was used in other machines that rely on precise coordinate-based movements, such as CNC (Computer Numerical Control) mills, drills, and plotters. While G-code is the common language for these machines, the GCODE files created for different types of equipment are not interchangeable, as each type of machine has specific requirements and capabilities.","NOTE: The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) designed G-code, but other organizations, such as Electronic Industries Association (RS-274) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO-6983), have since implemented various standards"]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/gcode_11010.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .gcode file in jherrm GCode Viewer","caption":"GCODE file open in jherrm GCode Viewer"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gcode.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
