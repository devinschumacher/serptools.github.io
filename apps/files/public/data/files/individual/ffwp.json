These forms can contain text, fillable fields, scripts that automatically fill in fields based on previous answers, images, and more.","After creating a form, users save that form as an FFWP file. They can then embed the FFWP file in a web application, to allow users who access the application to fill out the form. (These web applications typically save users' answers to a database.) Users can also distribute FFWP files offline, to allow others to fill out and submit the form without accessing the internet."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ffwp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
