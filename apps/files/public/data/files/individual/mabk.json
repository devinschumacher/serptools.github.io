To do so, users connect their mobile device to their PC and then select the Backup & restore option found within LMSA.","A user can choose to back up their device's stored contacts, text messages, pictures, songs, videos, and applications. Typically, users back up all these files. The backup data is then saved in a MABK file, which users keep on their PC in case they need to restore their mobile device's data or transfer the data to another device. Users can also use LMSA to extract files, such as songs, pictures, or videos, from their MABK file and open those files on their PCs."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mabk.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
