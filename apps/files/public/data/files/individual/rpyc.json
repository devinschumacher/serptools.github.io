Therefore, the RPY files can be deleted after the compiled scripts are generated. Any newer RPY scripts saved to the game directories will signal the Ren'Py engine to generate new RPYC files.","NOTE: Ren'Py version 5.3.0 introduced the .RPYB format, which stores bytecode used for running the game. Previously RPYC files included the bytecode, but now they only save compiled Python script."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"rpyc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
