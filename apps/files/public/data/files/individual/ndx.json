Optionally, dBASE users can create one or more index files for a dBASE database. These files contain select data and pointers to associated full records in the database, which dBASE can use to retrieve those records more quickly.","In versions III and below, dBASE saved index files in the NDX format. Notably, dBASE did not automatically update a database's associated NDX file(s) when a user made changes to the database. Instead, the user had to manually command dBASE to update the NDX file(s). In contrast, dBASE IV and above automatically update index files when a user makes a change to an associated database.","NOTE: dBASE stands for \"dataBased Intelligence.\""]},"how_to_open":{"detailed_instructions":["You can open an NDX file with dBASE (Windows) while editing an associated database."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/ndx_12096.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .ndx file in Nevron Software MyDraw 5","caption":"NDX file open in Nevron Software MyDraw 5"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ndx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
