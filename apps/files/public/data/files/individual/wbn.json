Saving a website in the WBN format packages all that website's files into a single file, which a user can then share over Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or a local network. Theoretically, other users can then open the WBN file in their web browser to access the website it contains, without connecting to the Internet.","Each WBN file is a renamed Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) file, which uses the .wbn extension instead of the .cbor extension. CBOR files are similar to .JSON files, except they store data primarily in a binary format, rather than as plain text.","NOTE: Google removed Chrome's support for WBN files in February 2023. It is possible that Google may restore Chrome's support for WBN files in the future."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/wbn_13224.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .wbn file in Web Archive Browsing Advanced Client","caption":"WBN file open in Web Archive Browsing Advanced Client"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"wbn.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
