Because these files contain a large amount of data, scientists often find it useful to compress the files for more efficient storage and to make them easier to share with others.","LASzip is a tool scientists can use to compress LAS files. It is included in the LAStools LIDAR data processing toolkit. When a scientist uses LASzip to compress a LAS file, LASzip saves the compressed version of the file as a LAZ file."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"laz.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
