JetBrains developed the Kotlin language to alleviate some of the common issues that arise in Java development. Most popularly, Kotlin is used to develop Android applications, as it is Google's preferred Android development language.","Developers creating Kotlin programs can create and include Kotlin scripts in those programs. These scripts are saved as KTS files. In addition to being referenced and run within Kotlin programs, developers can run KTS files independently. To run a script using the Kotlin compiler, a developer can use the command kotlinc -script filename.kts . Otherwise, the developer can run their script from within Jetbrains IntelliJ IDEA or Google Android Studio.","NOTE: Kotlin source code files that do not contain a Kotlin script are saved as .KT files."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/kts_12313.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .kts file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"KTS file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"kts.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
