DDAT files may be renamed with the \".avi\" extension to play a partial video download.","DDAT, DMSK, and DINFO files use the same file name prefix and are stored in the \"Temporary Downloaded Files\" directory of a DivX Player installation.","NOTE: DivX player initially reserves the full final DDAT file size on disk upon download and \"fills\" the file over time with the video file contents. For this reason, incomplete or halted downloads may take up excessive amounts of disk space."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ddat.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
