After writing code and creating assets in the development environment, developers use the SDK's pdc (Playdate compiler) command-line tool to package all scripts into one binary PDZ file that is placed in a .PDX file with the game's assets.","Playdate developers typically use PDZ files to share or sideload custom games and tools onto the Playdate. For example, developers can transfer a compiled PDZ file to a Playdate console for testing or distribution. They may also test PDZ files using the Playdate Simulator, a desktop tool included with the SDK."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pdz.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
