{"slug":"stormreplay","extension":"stormreplay","name":"Heroes of the Storm Replay File","category":"heroes-of-the-storm-replay-file","summary":"","developer_org":"blizzard-entertainment","developer_name":"Blizzard Entertainment","more_information":{"description":["Heroes of the Storm is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. In the game, players assume the role of one of the titular heroes and join with four other players to battle opposing five-person teams.","After a Heroes of the Storm match concludes, the game automatically saves a replay of that match on players' PCs. The replay is saved in a STORMREPLAY file. Players can access and watch STORMREPLAY files using the Watch button found on Heroes of the Storm's home screen.","Contrary to what you might expect, STORMREPLAY files are not video files (and thus cannot be opened in media players). Rather, they contain all the game data that Heroes of the Storm records during a match. The game uses this data to reconstruct a match in its entirety, so players can examine every aspect of a match when watching a Heroes of the Storm replay."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"stormreplay.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
