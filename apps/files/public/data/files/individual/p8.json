You may also acquire the P8 file if you download the source code of a PICO-8 game or receive it from another PICO-8 developer.","P8 files can be edited with PICO-8, which allows you to run the game locally and make builds of the game. PICO-8 comes with several editors, including Code, Sprite, Map, SFX, and Music, that enable you to modify specific parts of the game stored in the P8 file.","You can also modify a P8 file with a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad or Apple TextEdit. However, plain text editors do not provide the same syntax-highlighting features as PICO-8.","P8 files may also be compiled with PICO-8 into the binary .P8.PNG format. This format is used to store games that can be shared among other gamers and played in PICO-8.","NOTE: PICO-8 is a cross-platform program that allows you to create, play, and share tiny retro-style games. The games can be saved as \"virtual cartridges\" with .p8 or .p8.png file extensions."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/p8_11379.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .p8 file in Microsoft Notepad","caption":"P8 file open in Microsoft Notepad"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"p8.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
