This allowed users to share or back up multiple notebooks as a single file, rather than many separate files.","However, the Microsoft 365 version of OneNote does not allow users to create ONEPKG files, and it does not allow users to import existing ONEPKG files. If you want to import the notebooks a ONEPKG file contains into the Microsoft 365 version of OneNote, you must first extract those notebooks from the ONEPKG file."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"onepkg.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
