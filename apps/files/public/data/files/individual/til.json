The file is not meant to be manually opened by users. Instead, it is referenced by the Wii or Wii U console to load resources for menus and in-game graphics.","However, some users looking to modify the appearance of the CTGP-R menu will manually open a TIL file to alter the textures stored within it. After making their changes, they will package the textures back into the TIL archive in the CTGP-R mod, transfer it to an SD card, and insert the SD card in the Wii or Wii U to play the mod. The user must have a valid copy of Mario Kart Wii to play the mod."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"textures.tile","description":"textures.tile - Name of the TIL file packaged with CTGP-R.
