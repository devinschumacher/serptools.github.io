Developer Tim Thompson created the language and accompanying program in the 1990s, during the time he worked at AT&T. While KeyKit was originally released through AT&T, it is now available for free from GitHub.","KeyKit was developed for use on Windows NT , but still works on modern Windows, Linux, and Raspberry Pi systems. So if you have a KC file sitting on your computer, you can still open it and play the musical sequences it contains using KeyKit. Additionally, KeyKit comes loaded with a number of sample KC files, including rock-, jazz-, rap-, funk-, and reggae-inspired collections."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/kc_11571.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .kc file in KeyKit","caption":"KC file open in KeyKit"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"kc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
