The program is available as a .ZIP or .TAR.GZ package that users can install on Linux or Windows.","When moviemakers save an in-progress animation project in qStopMotion, the project is saved as a QSMD file. A QSMD file is an XML file that contains information about the frames, takes, and scenes a project includes. After a user finishes editing their animation, they can use their QSMD file to export the animation as an MP4 or other video file."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"qsmd.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
