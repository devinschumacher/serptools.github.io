{"slug":"rpkg","extension":"rpkg","name":"Glacier 2 Engine Resource Package","category":"glacier-2-engine-resource-package","summary":"","developer_org":"eka2l1","developer_name":"EKA2L1","more_information":{"description":["In the Hitman series ( Hitman: Absolution , Hitman 2016 , Hitman 2 2018 , and Hitman 3 ), RPKG files also serve as patch files. When the game receives an update through Steam or another launcher, new or modified assets arrive in additional RPKG archives.","During startup, the engine merges these patch archives with the existing game data, so players see updated levels, textures, or voice lines without the need to overwrite the original files. For this reason, you should not move or delete any RPKG files in the gameâ€™s directory.","NOTE: Other Glacier-based titles, such as Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days and the Freedom Fighters remaster, use the same RPKG format (or slight variations of it) to store their game content."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"rpkg.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
