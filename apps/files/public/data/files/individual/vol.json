Instead, several game development studios used and implemented the format in various forms during the 1990s and early 2000s. Most notably, it was used by Dynamix, a game studio under Sierra On-Line, in titles such as EarthSiege 2 and the Tribes series. Later, Planet Moon Studios used a variation of the format in Giants: Citizen Kabuto .","Each developer typically implemented a custom version of the VOL format tailored to their game engine's needs, so while the .vol file extension remained the same, the internal structure could differ significantly between games. As a result, VOL files from different games are often not interchangeable and may require game-specific tools to extract or modify."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"GT.vol","description":"GT.vol - Common name for the VOL archive included with various versions of Gran Turismo, including version 5."}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vol.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
