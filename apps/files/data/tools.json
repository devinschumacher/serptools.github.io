          "question": "What is HEIC format?",
          "answer": "HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container) is Apple's default image format for photos taken on iPhone and iPad devices running iOS 11 or later. It uses HEIF compression to save storage space while maintaining high quality."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why do I need to convert HEIC to JPG?",
          "answer": "While HEIC offers excellent compression, many devices, applications, and websites don't support it. Converting to JPG ensures your photos can be viewed and shared on any platform without compatibility issues."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will converting HEIC to JPG reduce quality?",
          "answer": "Our converter maintains optimal quality during conversion. While JPG uses different compression, we ensure minimal quality loss while producing files that work everywhere."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I batch convert multiple HEIC files?",
          "answer": "Yes! You can drag and drop or select multiple HEIC files to convert them all to JPG at once. Each file is processed individually and downloaded automatically."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is my privacy protected?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. All conversions happen locally in your browser. Your photos never leave your device and aren't uploaded to any server, ensuring complete privacy."

        {
          "question": "Will my photo look the same as SVG?",
          "answer": "Photos converted to SVG will have a stylized, posterized appearance. SVG works best for logos, icons, and simple graphics rather than photographic images."

        {
          "question": "What are the benefits of SVG?",
          "answer": "SVG files are infinitely scalable without quality loss, editable in design software, and often smaller than raster images for simple graphics. They're perfect for responsive web design."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I edit the resulting SVG?",
          "answer": "Yes, SVG files can be edited in vector graphics software like Illustrator, Inkscape, or even with a text editor since SVG is an XML-based format."

        {
          "question": "When should I use SVG instead of JPG?",

          "question": "Why would I convert MP4 to AVI?",
          "answer": "AVI format ensures compatibility with older Windows systems, legacy media players, and devices that don't support modern MP4 containers. It's essential for maintaining video libraries that need to work with older hardware or software."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will AVI files be larger than MP4?",
          "answer": "Generally yes. AVI is an older format with less efficient compression than MP4. Expect file sizes to be 20-50% larger, but you gain compatibility with systems that can't handle modern video formats."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does converting to AVI reduce video quality?",
          "answer": "Some quality loss may occur since AVI typically requires re-encoding the video stream. We use high-quality settings to minimize this, but MP4's modern compression is generally superior to AVI's older codecs."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can all devices play AVI files?",
          "answer": "AVI has excellent compatibility with Windows systems and older devices, but limited support on mobile platforms and modern streaming devices. It's best for desktop use and legacy hardware compatibility."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long does MP4 to AVI conversion take?",
          "answer": "Longer than container-only conversions since re-encoding is usually required. Expect 2-5x the video duration for conversion time, depending on file size and your device's processing power."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is the conversion process secure?",

        {
          "question": "How long does MP4 to WebM conversion take?",
          "answer": "WebM conversion is slower than container changes since it requires re-encoding with VP8/VP9 codecs. Expect conversion to take 3-7x the video duration, but the quality and size benefits are worth it for web use."

        {
          "question": "How does MJPEG compare to MP4 for editing?",
          "answer": "MJPEG is superior for editing because every frame is independently encoded, allowing instant seeking and precise frame editing. MP4's interframe compression requires more processing for frame-accurate editing."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the file size implications of MJPEG?",
          "answer": "MJPEG files are significantly larger than MP4 because each frame is individually compressed without interframe compression. However, this provides the benefit of frame-independent editing."
        },
        {
          "question": "What applications work best with MJPEG?",
