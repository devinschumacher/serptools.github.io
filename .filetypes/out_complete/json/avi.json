      "The AVI format is based on the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF), a container format initially released in 1991 to store multimedia. MICROSOFT INTRODUCED the AVI format a year later in 1992 and is still commonly used today.",
      "The AVI video format can store high-quality video and audio and typically uses less compression than other similar video formats such as .MPEG and .MOV . While this means the video quality will be high, it results in large AVI file sizes, which can be problematic for users with limited space."
