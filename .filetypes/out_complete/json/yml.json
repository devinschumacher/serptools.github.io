  "summary": "A YML file is a text document that contains data formatted using YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language), a human-readable data format used for data serialization. It is used for reading and writing data independent of a specific programming language. Because YAML syntax is language-agnostic, YML files can be incorporated into programs written in most popular programming languages, including C/C++, Ruby, Python, Java, Perl, C#, PHP, and others.",

      "YML files are most commonly used as configuration files, which define a program or application's settings. If a program uses a YML file as a settings file, you can edit the program's settings by opening and editing the YML file in a text or source code editor. Most settings-related YML files include comments that explain how the file can be used to adjust a program's settings.",
      "NOTE: YAML files are more commonly saved with the .YAML extension."

These applications provide helpful source code editing tools and highlight YAML syntax correctly."
