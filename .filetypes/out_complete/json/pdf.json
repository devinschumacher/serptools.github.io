  "summary": "A PDF file is a widely used document type that maintains the original layout and formatting across different devices and operating systems. It is often used for sharing documents, such as reports, contracts, manuals, or forms, ensuring that the content appears the same for all users. PDF files can include text, images, annotations, and even interactive elements (e.g., buttons and checkboxes), and users typically create them from other file formats, such as Word .DOCX documents, Excel .XLSX spreadsheets, and images.",
