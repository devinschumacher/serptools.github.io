      "TXT files are simple text documents that contain little to no formatting. They often store notes, step-by-step instructions, manuscripts, and other text-based information.",
      "Windows and macOS both include simple text editors that can save text documents as TXT files, including Microsoft Notepad and Apple TextEdit. When the editors save a document as a TXT file, they remove its formatting (bolding, italicization, font style, alignment, etc.).",
      "Users who need to create more complicated text documents, such as resumes, reports, letters, or flyers, typically do not save them as TXT files. Instead, they use word processors, such as Microsoft Word or Apple Pages, to create and save their documents as .DOCX or .PAGES files.",
      "NOTE: Various non-PC devices, such as smartphones and the Amazon Kindle, and web browsers, such as Chrome and Firefox, also recognize plain text files."
