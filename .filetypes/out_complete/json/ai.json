  "summary": "An AI file is a vector graphic created by Adobe Illustrator or exported by another graphics program, such as Adobe Photoshop. Unlike raster images , which are made up of pixels, AI files store graphics as paths connected by anchor points using the Adobe Illustrator Artwork (AI) format. This vector-based structure allows users to scale artwork up or down without losing image quality, making AI files ideal for logos, illustrations, icons, and print-ready designs.",

      "Graphic designers, illustrators, and digital artists widely use AI files when creating precise and editable artwork. AI files support layers, shapes, text, gradients, transparency, and advanced features like artboards and custom brushes. Designers often choose the AI format when they need a working file they can revisit and update, as it preserves the original vector data and design elements created in Illustrator.",
      "While AI files are best opened and edited in Adobe Illustrator, many other programs, including Adobe Acrobat, Photoshop, and some third-party design tools, support viewing or converting them. For broader compatibility, users often export AI files to more widely supported formats like .PDF , .SVG , .EPS , or .PNG for use in web design, printing, or sharing with clients. When sending artwork for professional use, itâ€™s helpful to include both the original AI file and a flattened export in one of these standard formats."

      "You can open an AI file with Adobe Illustrator in Windows and macOS. Illustrator is the best option for opening AI files because it fully supports the formatting of Illustrator artwork. To open an AI file with Illustrator, select File â†’ Open .",
      "You can also open AI files with other third-party applications, such as ACD Systems Canvas (Windows), CorelDRAW Graphics Suite (Windows and macOS), GIMP (multiplatform), and Inkscape (multiplatform). Remember that these applications may not fully support the AI format, or they may rasterize the image, meaning the vector data will be converted to a bitmap format.",
      "ðŸ’¡ If you are a Mac user, you can also view AI files with Apple Preview , which is bundled with macOS."
