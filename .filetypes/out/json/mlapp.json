  "summary": "An MLAPP file is an application project created by The MathWorks MATLAB, a programming and numeric computing program for analyzing data, developing algorithms, and building models. It stores information about an app in the proprietary MATLAB App (MLAPP) format, including the layout of its visual components, the MATLAB code configuring the app's capabilities, and metadata . Examples of apps you might create and save as MLAPP files include a data visualizer for measuring and graphing blood sample data or a tool for measuring the different energy outputs of solar panels.",
