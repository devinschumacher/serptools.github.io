It contains information about a 3D scene, including the position, size, and faces of cubes (in plain text), and may include one or more .TGA or .PNG textures. Blockbench users with the Preview Scene Customiser plugin installed typically save scenes as BBSCENE files when creating and modifying scenes for video games.",
