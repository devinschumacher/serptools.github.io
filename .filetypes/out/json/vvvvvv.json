  "summary": "A VVVVVV file is a custom level used by VVVVVV , an indie platformer game developed by Terry Cavanagh. It stores the layout, design, and elements of a user-created level, including room structure, enemy placement, music, and scripts. VVVVVV players often create VVVVVV files with the built-in Level Editor included with the game, or with third-party editors like VED (VVVVVV External Editor).",
