It is supposed to contain a binary list of 64 predesigned missions that can be completed in Mission Mode. While the official Mario Kart Wii game disc does not include mission_single.kmt , Mario Kart fans have created their own homebrew replacements for the file, which allow them to load and play Mission Mode.",
