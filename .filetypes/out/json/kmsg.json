  "summary": "A KMSG file is a data file created by Wyze cameras that stores information about .MP4 video recordings captured by the cameras. The files typically accompany .LOG files on microSD cards inserted into the cameras. When users transfer a microSD card from the camera to their computer, they may encounter the KMSG file in the log folders (e.g., \"log_0000\" and \"log_0000 2\" folders).",
