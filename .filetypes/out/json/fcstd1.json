  "summary": "An FCSTD1 file is a backup of an .FCSTD CAD file created by FreeCAD, a free, cross-platform CAD design application. It contains the save state of an FCSTD file, which includes a 2D or 3D design and the geometry for the components. FCSTD1 files are helpful for saving a backup of a CAD document in case the program crashes or the user needs to revert to a previous save state of the document.",
