  "summary": "A PJPEG file is a bitmap image created in the Progressive JPEG format (PJPEG), which stores multiple \"scans\" of an image a web browser displays progressively at a higher quality to provide the user a preview of the image as it loads. Since PJPEG files are a variation of the baseline JPEG format, you can open them by renaming the .pjpeg extension to .jpg .",
