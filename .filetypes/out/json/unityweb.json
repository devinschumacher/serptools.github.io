  "summary": "A UNITYWEB file is a binary game data file used by a Unity WebGL video game. It contains either the game's JavaScript runtime and plug-ins, the game's WebAssembly, a binary image used to initialize the heap memory for the game's player, or the game's asset and scene data. UNITYWEB files may be compressed using gzip or Brotli compression, or they may be uncompressed, depending on how the developer who created the files chose to build their game.",
