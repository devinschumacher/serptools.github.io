  "summary": "An AAB file is an Android App Bundle that developers use for uploading apps to Google Play. After upload, Google Play uses a process called Dynamic Delivery to deliver optimized versions of app packages ( .APK files) to user devices so they contain only the specific portions of the app that each device needs to run. With Dynamic Delivery, app install sizes can be reduced significantly on user devices.",
