  "summary": "An FZPZ file is a part used in an electronic circuit design created by Fritzing, a circuit prototyping and design application. It is a compressed archive that contains an .FZP file and four .SVG images, which are used to show the part in Fritzing. Fritzing users often share FZPZ files with each other, allowing them to import and use others' parts in their own circuits.",
