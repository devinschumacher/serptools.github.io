  "summary": "A DWSUPLOAD file is a partially uploaded file that stores the contents of a file a user transfers from one device to another with DWService, software that allows users to remotely connect to their home computer. The .dwsupload extension is temporary; DWService removes it once the upload is complete and replaces it with the extension of the file the software is transferring (the .dwsupload extension remains if the transfer is interrupted).",
