  "summary": "An FFT file is an audio filter used by Adobe Audition, an audio production application. It saves settings that limit audio frequencies so that certain portions of the waveform can be isolated or pronounced, including the sample type and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) information. The FFT format is helpful for audio engineers since it allows them to fine-tune the sound of audio data.",
