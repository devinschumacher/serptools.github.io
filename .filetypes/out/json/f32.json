  "summary": "An F32 file is an audio file that stores raw sound data in a 32-bit floating point format, which is uncompressed sound information represented as numerical values that describe the sound waves. Unlike common audio formats, such as .MP3 and .WAV , an F32 file does not include headers or metadata , only the raw audio data. F32 files are typically used in professional audio editing and processing, where high-quality, uncompressed sound is needed.",
