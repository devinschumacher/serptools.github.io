  "summary": "A PP3 file is a settings file used by RawTherapee, a free photo editing program designed for processing RAW image files from digital cameras. It stores a list of adjustments in plain text that a user has applied to an image in RawTherapee, such as exposure, contrast, white balance, color correction, and sharpening. RawTherapee saves these adjustments separately from the image in a PP3 file that accompanies the image, allowing users to apply or reuse settings without altering the original photo.",
