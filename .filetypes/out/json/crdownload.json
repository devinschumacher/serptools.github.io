  "summary": "A CRDOWNLOAD file is a partially downloaded file created by Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Chromium web browsers that stores the contents of a file while the browser downloads it. The .crdownload extension is temporary, and the web browser removes it once the download is complete. However, if the download is interrupted, the CRDOWNLOAD file remains, and you must resume the download via the web browser to complete it.",
