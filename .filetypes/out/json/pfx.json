  "summary": "A PFX file is an encrypted security format that typically stores one or more password-protected digital certificates and private keys for authenticating a person, application, or device (including computers and web servers). PFX files were initially saved in the Personal Information Exchange (PFX) format Microsoft released in 1996 but are now saved in the PKCS #12 format, which succeeded and extended PFX (people often use the format names interchangeably). Users typically send PFX files to transfer private and public keys and other sensitive information; various security and encryption programs support PFX files.",
