  "summary": "An SO file is a shared library used by programs installed on the Linux and Android operating systems . It contains common program functions and logic that multiple programs require access to. SO files allow programs to access common functions from one shared place in a computer's system memory , rather than implementing their own versions of the functions. This streamlines the programs' structure as well as their interaction with users' operating systems.",
