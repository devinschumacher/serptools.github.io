  "summary": "An XCODEPROJ file is a software development project created with Apple Xcode, an IDE for macOS. It is a macOS package that stores all of the information for the project, including references to source files (such as source code, resources, and image files) and project configuration data (such as debug and release build settings). Xcode users save the software they are developing for macOS, iOS, watchOS, or tvOS as XCODEPROJ files to preserve their progress, then compile their software projects into executable apps for distribution.",
