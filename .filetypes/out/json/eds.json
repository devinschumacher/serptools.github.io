  "summary": "An EDS file is a disk image formatted for an Ensoniq SQ-80 synthesizer, a digital workstation released by Ensoniq in 1987. It contains data dumped from a floppy disk , which includes sequences and effects. SQ-80 users would use floppy disks to add sequences and effects to the synthesizer, but users dump the data from the disks to EDS files to play their sounds.",
