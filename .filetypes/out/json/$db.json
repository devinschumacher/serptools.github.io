  "summary": "A $DB file is a temporary database the dBASE database management software automatically creates while a user works on a database ( .DBF file). The purpose of the file is to store changes made to a database that the software can reference to recover if dBASE unexpectedly quits due to a computer crash, loss of power, etc. When a user is done working on a database and closes it, dBASE automatically deletes the $DB file.",
