  "summary": "A PIF file contains information used to define how an MS-DOS-based program should run. It can also serve as a shortcut to an executable file, much like a .LNK file, and is commonly created when the user makes a shortcut to a DOS program or modifies the properties of the program. PIF files contain various information such as the path for the .EXE file, how much memory to use, font size, screen colors, and the size of the program's window.",
