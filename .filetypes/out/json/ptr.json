  "summary": "A PTR file is a project file created by TrendyFlash Desktop Flash Intro Builder, a now-discontinued application for creating Flash-based intro animations. It stores the content and settings that comprise the Flash intros, such as text, images, animations, and layout preferences. PTR files are working files users can save, close, reopen, and continue editing before exporting the final animation as a Flash file (typically in .SWF format).",
