  "summary": "A STORYTEMPLATE file is a project template created by Articulate Storyline 360, a program for developing e-learning content, such as interactive training courses and presentations. It is saved in the same format as a .STORY file, storing all the elements of a course, such as slides, animations, quizzes, text, video, audio, user interactions, and metadata . While STORYTEMPLATES are saved in the same format as STORY files, they are used to store learning courses that Instructional designers, corporate trainers, educators, etc., want to replicate with the same content and appearance.",
