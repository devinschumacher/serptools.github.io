  "summary": "A PYD file is a Python Dynamic Module (PDM), an extension similar to a .DLL file that can be imported and used in Python programs. It contains compiled code, often written in languages like C or C++ , which allows Python programs to perform tasks that require more speed or access to low-level system resources. PYD files enhance Python's capabilities by providing additional functionality, such as interacting with system hardware or optimizing performance for specific tasks.",
