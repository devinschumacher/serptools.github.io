  "summary": "A PCG file contains a collection of instruments for the Korg Triton, Trinity, and PA synthesizers and keyboards. It stores details like instrument names, the samples they use, and other settings such as oscillators, keyboard splits, and velocity ranges. However, PCG files don't contain audio data; they hold the information needed to recreate the instruments on a Korg device.",
