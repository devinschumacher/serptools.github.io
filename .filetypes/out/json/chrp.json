  "summary": "A CHRP file contains electronic music data in the proprietary Chirp (CHRP) format that CTR Electronics (CTRE) devices with compatible Talon FX motors load to play music. It stores music data converted from a .MIDI file via Phoenix Tuner X, a companion app for configuring and managing CTR Electronics devices. CTRE devices, most prominently robotics, play CHRP files to play a melody during self-tests or robotics competitions to entertain the audience.",
