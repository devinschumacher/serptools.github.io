  "summary": "An AFBOOK file is a book created by Serif Affinity Publisher that stores one or more documents as chapters. It is similar to an .AFPUB file but supports multiple AFPUB files and includes book-related information, such as the order of chapters, master pages, and styles. Affinity Publisher users often save projects as AFBOOK files that are more extensive than the typical brochure, invitation, flyer, etc., page layout projects.",
