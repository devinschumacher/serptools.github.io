  "summary": "An LWS file is a three-dimensional scene created with LightWave 3D, a 3D modeling, animation, and rendering program. It contains information about object positions and movements, cameras and their movements, and references to the locations of .LWO files that store 3D objects appearing in the scene. LWS files are saved in the LightWave 3D Scene (LWS) format, which stores scene information in plain text .",
