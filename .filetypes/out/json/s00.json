  "summary": "An S00 file is the first part of a file that was split using ZipSplitter, a program used to split files for easier transportation. It contains a segment of a larger file, such as a .WMV or .MP4 file, that is one part of several other parts. S00 files can be restored, along with the other parts ( .S01 , .S02 , etc.) by double-clicking the .EXE file included with the split file.",
