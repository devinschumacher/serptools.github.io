  "summary": "An ROV file is a configuration file used by now-discontinued Actuate reporting software to define parameters for generating Report Object Instance ( .ROI ) reports. It specifies what data should be included in an ROI report, including the information imported from various data sources, such as spreadsheets, databases, and real-time business systems. Users can control how data is filtered, grouped, or displayed in the final report by modifying the values in an ROV file.",
