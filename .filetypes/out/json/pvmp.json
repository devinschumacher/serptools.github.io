  "summary": "A PVMP file is a Parallels Virtual Machine ( .PVM file) a user has \"packed\" with Parallels Desktop emulation software to transfer it to another computer. It contains a virtual machine (VM) saved in the proprietary PVMP format, which utilizes a unique compression algorithm. PVMP files are similar to .PVMZ files, but Parallels Desktop for Mac compresses them with PVMP compression instead of Zip compression.",
