  "summary": "A MOT file contains a 3D motion created by LightWave 3D, a professional graphics application for rendering animated and still 3D images. It saves one or more keyframe coordinates in plain text for an object or camera, including its location, rotation, and scale. LightWave 3D users save and load MOT files to preserve movements they can re-apply to other objects or cameras.",
