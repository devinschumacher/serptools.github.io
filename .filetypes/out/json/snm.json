  "summary": "An SNM file is an index file used by several discontinued email programs, such as Netscape Messenger and Netscape Collabra, to organize and manage email messages in a user's mailbox. It stores a reference to each email, allowing the program to locate and display messages quickly without scanning the entire mailbox each time. While no longer used, SNM files were important at the time for improving efficiency in email clients.",
