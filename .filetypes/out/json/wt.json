It contains a collection of data blocks in the WiredTiger (WT) format, a proprietary format MongoDB uses as tables to make up a database. The first block in a WT file is a WT_BLOCK_DESC block that includes metadata to verify the legitimacy of the data and prevent corruption, followed by blocks storing data that makes up the table.",
