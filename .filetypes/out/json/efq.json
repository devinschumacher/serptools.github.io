  "summary": "An EFQ file is a sound data file used by the Ensoniq SQ-1, SQ-2, and KS-32 synthesizers, which are digital music workstations released in the early 1990s. It stores specific voice, patch, or performance data that defines how the synthesizer produces a particular sound. Musicians and producers typically use EFQ files to save and load custom sound settings, making it easier to reuse or share patches across different sessions or devices.",
