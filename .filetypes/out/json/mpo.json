  "summary": "An MPO file is a stereoscopic image saved in the Multi Picture Object (MPO) format, which consists of two 2D .JPG images combined into one 3D image. Various digital cameras, such as the Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D series, capture images as MPO files, and Nintendo 3DS may also create them. Users with 3D TVs typically view MPO files as 3D pictures, but various computer applications, such as StereoPhoto Maker and XstereO Player, also support them.",
