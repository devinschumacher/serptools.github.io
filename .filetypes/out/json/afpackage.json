  "summary": "An AFPACKAGE file contains a Serif Affinity document, such as an .AFPUB , .AFDESIGN , or .AFPHOTO file, packaged with its resources (fonts, linked images, etc.). Since Serif Affinity documents store references to their resources separately, Affinity Publisher, Designer, and Photo users create AFPACKAGE files to store the documents and their resources in one AFPACKAGE file when transferring them to different computers or for printing purposes.",
