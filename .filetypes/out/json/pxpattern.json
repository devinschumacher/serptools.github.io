  "summary": "A PXPATTERN file is a pattern created by Pixen, a pixel art editor developed by Furnace Creek Software for macOS. It stores tileable image patterns that artists can apply repeatedly across a canvas to create consistent backgrounds, textures, or decorative elements. PXPATTERN files are especially helpful for users creating pixel-based artwork, game environments, or repeating textures that require uniform visual elements.",
