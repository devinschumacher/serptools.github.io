  "summary": "A PDTXT file is a modified Pure Data ( .PD ) patch file that improves accessibility for visually impaired users working with the Pure Data visual programming environment. It defines audio or multimedia programs using a visual programming structure, including accessible object labels, custom variable names, comments, and additional metadata to aid screen reader support and usability. It is the same as a .PD2 file, which users with older systems often use, as some older systems struggle to recognize file extensions with more than three characters.",
