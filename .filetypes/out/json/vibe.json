  "summary": "A VIBE file is a data file created by SensationSoft VibePlayer, an audio and video player for Android that allows users to feel vibrations from the device while media is played. It contains haptic data that syncs with an audio or video file, such as an .MP3 or .MP4 file, so that when the media is played in the app the user can feel the physical vibrations through the device. VIBE files are used to enhance the experience of a user watching or listening to media in VibePlayer.",
