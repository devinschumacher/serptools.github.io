  "summary": "An AET file is a project template created by Adobe After Effects, used to start new video projects with a predefined structure. It contains one or more compositions, which may include imported media, shapes, text layers, effects, and project settings. Unlike regular project files ( .AEP or .AEPX ), AET files serve as reusable templates for creating multiple After Effects projects with consistent layouts or settings.",
