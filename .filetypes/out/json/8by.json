  "summary": "An 8BY file is a parser plugin for the Windows version of Adobe Photoshop, an industry-standard image editor. It stores information that adds parsing capabilities to the software, which enables the program to open and work with additional image formats or embedded file information that it doesnâ€™t natively support. Users can add 8BY plugins to the app by placing the files in the Plug-ins folder within the Photoshop application folder.",
