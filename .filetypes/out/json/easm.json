  "summary": "An EASM file is a 3D CAD assembly file created using Dassault Syst√®mes eDrawings Publisher, a plugin that allows users to export models from various CAD applications. It stores multiple parts that comprise a larger assembly, such as an engine or gearbox, in the eDrawings Assembly (EASM) format, which is based on the HOOPS Stream Format ( .HSF ). EASM files allow users to send 3D models to others in a format that is easier to share and view than other proprietary 3D formats.",
