  "summary": "An RSDK file is a game asset archive used by titles developed with the Retro Engine, such as Sonic CD , Sonic Mania , and Penny’s Big Breakaway . It contains most of a game’s resources, including sprites , audio, 3D models, configuration data, level layouts, and scenario files (often stored as .BIN files). The Retro SDK (RSDK) format allows developers to bundle large amounts of data into a single, structured archive, simplifying asset management and game deployment.",
