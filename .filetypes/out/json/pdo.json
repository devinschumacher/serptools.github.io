  "summary": "A PDO file is a papercraft file created by Pepakura Designer, a program used to turn digital 3D models into physical papercraft models. It contains a 3D model and its corresponding 2D papercraft cutouts. The 2D cutouts that PDO files contain are meant to be printed, so a papercraft enthusiast can assemble the cutouts into a replica of the 3D model.",
