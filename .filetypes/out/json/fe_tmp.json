  "summary": "An FE_TMP file is a temporary file created by Mi File Explorer, a file manager for Xiaomi smartphones. Mi File Explorer creates a new FE_TMP file whenever a user moves, copies, or deletes a file. In most cases, Mi File Explorer automatically deletes FE_TMP files after completing the related file operation. If Mi File Explorer fails to delete an FE_TMP file, it can cause the user's phone to believe their SD card is invalid.",
