  "summary": "A VRMANIFEST file is a JSON file that contains metadata used to show and launch a StreamVR video game. It specifies the game's app key, launch type, name, and controller type, as well as where the game's SteamVR menu image is stored. Each SteamVR game has a VRMANIFEST file that contains metadata about just that game. SteamVR also uses an overarching VRMANIFEST file, named steamapps.vrmanifest , which contains metadata about all a user's games, including where those games' manifest files are stored.",
