  "summary": "A TD0 file is a disk image created using Teledisk, a utility originally for archiving and duplicating floppy disks in the 1980s and 90s. It stores an exact copy of a floppy diskâ€™s contents, including its files and low-level disk structure. TD0 files are compressed to reduce storage size, which was especially important when dealing with limited disk space in the 1980s and 90s.",
