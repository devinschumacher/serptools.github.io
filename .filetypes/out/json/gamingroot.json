  "summary": "A GAMINGROOT file is a hidden system file used by the Xbox and Game Bar apps on Windows 10 or 11 to indicate that a particular drive is suitable for game installation. When these apps identify a drive as appropriate for storing games, they automatically create a GAMINGROOT file on it. GAMINGROOT files are unnamed and appear as .GamingRoot . Users should not delete these files since doing so could prevent games from functioning properly.",
