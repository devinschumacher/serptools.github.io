  "summary": "A PTA file contains a series of actions for a character in Pony Town, an online multiplayer game where players can customize pony characters. It stores emotes, animations, and other interactive commands a player creates and uses within the game, allowing for custom character movements and interactions beyond the basic built-in actions. PTA files enable players to save and share custom actions to quickly set up action bars to match their preferences or those of other players.",
