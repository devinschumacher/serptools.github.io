  "summary": "An A3P file is a 3D animation created using Alice 3, the third iteration of the Alice programming language and integrated development environment ( IDE ). It contains source code that defines the animation's environment, characters, objects, and movements. However, A3P files are binary files, so you cannot view the code they contain in a text or source code editor. To view the animation and code an A3P file contains, you must open it in Alice 3.",
