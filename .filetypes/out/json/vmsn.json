  "summary": "A VMSN file saves the virtual machine (VM) data for a snapshot, which is a frozen state of the VM saved at a particular point in time. VMware virtualization software creates a VMSN file when a user takes a snapshot of a VM, which allows them to revert a VM to a saved point. VMSN files are saved with a .VMSD file, which contains the metadata for the snapshot.",
