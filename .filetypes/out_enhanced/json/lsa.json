      "Xiaomi MIUI Gallery is the default photo and video gallery app installed on Xiaomi MIUI smartphones. In Gallery, users can choose to hide photos and videos, so other users cannot view those files. The exact steps used to hide photos and videos vary in different versions of Gallery, but they always involve:",
      "As Gallery moves the selected photos and videos to its private folder (located at ~/​MIUI/​Gallery/​cloud/​secretAlbum ), it encrypts them and changes their extensions to either .lsa (photos) or .LSAV (videos). Because these files are encrypted and password-protected, they can be opened only from within Gallery, by accessing your private folder."
