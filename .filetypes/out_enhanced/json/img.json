      "IMG files created by different disk imaging programs may use different formats. For example, IMG files created by SlySoft CloneCD must be paired with an associated .CCD and .SUB file before they can be used to create a disc. Before using an IMG file to create a new disc, you should attempt to determine what program created the IMG file and check whether your disc-authoring program can burn files saved in that format."
