      "You can export a calendar to an ICBU archive by selecting File → Export... → Calendar Archive... in Calendar. The ICBU archive is a macOS package with the .icbu extension, containing subfolders for each calendar and .SQLITEDB and .PLIST files storing event data. In older versions of Apple Calendar, the archive contains .ICS files instead of SQLite databases.",
      "NOTE: Calendar was formerly known as iCal, but Apple changed it in 2012 with the release of OS X Mountain Lion."
