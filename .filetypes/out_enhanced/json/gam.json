      "Half-Life is a first-person shooter (FPS) developed by Valve and released in 1998. In the game, scientist Gordon Freeman must escape the Black Mesa Research Facility as it is attacked by aliens.",
      "Originally, Half-Life was published as a CD-ROM-based game available for Windows. This version of Half-Life allowed players to create and add custom game modes, which were available to select from within the game. Later, Valve re-released Half-Life through the Steam gaming platform. This version of Half-Life also allows players to create and launch custom game modes, but shows those game modes as separate games in players' Steam game library.",
      "The data used to show and load a custom Half-Life game mode is saved in its own directory, usually named to indicate what kind of game mode the directory contains. To be used with Half-Life, this directory must be stored in the game's main installation directory, and it must include a settings file named liblist.gam .",
      "Liblist.gam can contain settings used to:",
      "Some liblist.gam files may contain additional settings."
