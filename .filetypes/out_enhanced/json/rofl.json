      "ROFL files are created to store a replay when you select the download button next to \"Advanced Details\" from the \"End of Game\" screen. After you download the replay, select \"Watch Replay\" in order to view the replay of your gameplay. A replay lasts until you install a new patch of the game. For example, a replay created by LoL 7.3 expires when you update to 7.4."
