      "AlgoBox is designed for teaching high school and college students about mathematical algorithms. The program is only available in French.",
      "The ALG file is the main file type associated with the program. It is created when a user saves an algorithm by selecting Fichier (File) â†’ Sauver (Save) or Sauver Sous (Save As) . Users can also export an algorithm as plain text ( .TXT file), a webpage ( .HTML file), an .ODT file, a .TEX file, a .PNG image, or a .PDF file."
