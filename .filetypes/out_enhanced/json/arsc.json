      "When a developer compiles an Android program (using Android Studio or another development tool), the compiler transforms all the programs' resources, including images, layouts, styles, and strings, into binary files. It also assigns each resource a unique ID. The compiler then creates an ARSC file (typically named resources.arsc ) that lists all the program's compiled resources and their IDs.",
      "At runtime, the program uses its ARSC file to quickly locate and access resources. In this way, Android programs can standardly access resources, no matter the resource's type or where it is stored or referenced in the program's source code."
