      "Kano Code is an online artwork-coding app that allows you to drag and drop code blocks to create artwork. For example, you could add several blocks of code that fill the background color of your canvas as orange, draw blue circles every 3 seconds, and insert an image of an alligator.",
      "To create a KCODE file with Kano Code, select Menu → New Creation , add your code, then select Menu → Save . After choosing Save , your browser will instantly begin downloading a KCODE file that stores your saved creation. You can store the KCODE file on your computer as a backup file or open it again with Kano Code to resume editing the artwork."
