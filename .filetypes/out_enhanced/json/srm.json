      "Emulators create SRM files by storing an emulated game's current Saved RAM (SRAM) state in a file. Typically, this happens when a player uses a game's default Save option to save their game. Later, the player can use this file to resume their saved game. They can also share the file with other players, to allow those players to load the saved game.",
      "To load an SRM file, a player must possess a corresponding game ROM. For example, to load an SRM file created from the game The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, a player must possess both the SRM file and an A Link to the Past ROM (likely stored in a .ZIP file). Also, both files must use the same filename (except their extensions)."
