      "An audio project saved in the OMF format can store multiple audio tracks, volume and pan information, and references to audio files. However, not all settings, such as insertion effects and channel routing options, may be saved in an OMF file. Therefore, not all project and track settings may be transferred when opening an OMF file in another application."
