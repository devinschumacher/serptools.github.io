      "ClassiCube is a nostalgic Minecraft clone that includes only the game's original features. It is available for all major platforms, including PC and mobile platforms.",
      "When a player begins playing ClassiCube, the game creates a fresh game world. If a player wants to save their progress in a game world, they can open ClassiCube's game menu (by pressing Esc ) and select Save level... . This allows the player to save their world's current state as a CW file.",
      "If a player wants to resume playing in a saved world, they can do so by loading the corresponding CW file from ClassiCube's game menu. Players also sometimes share their CW files online, to allow others to adventure within those game worlds."
