      "Researchers use TissUUmaps to visualize and analyze data from tissue samples. The program was created by a group at Uppsala University in Sweden, and it is available for download online.",
      "To create a TissUUmaps project, researchers first load one or more images saved in one of the program's supported whole slide image formats (such as .TIF , .VMU , .SCN , or .SVSLIDE ). They can then apply filters, add markers, and draw regions on each image, to aid them in performing their analysis.",
      "At any time, a user can save their current TissUUmap project as a TMAP file. This file contains a JSON record of the project's imported images, layers and layer properties, filters, regions, and associated plug-ins (plug-ins used while creating the project). The user can later load this file to resume working on their project."
