      "A RAY file is typically created from measurements of real light sources or a ray sensor collecting light ray data. Synopsys programs, such as LightTools and LucidShape, use RAY files to import light ray data to simulate the effects of light in various systems, such as automotive lighting, projectors, and solar lighting."
