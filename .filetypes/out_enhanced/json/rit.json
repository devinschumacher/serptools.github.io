      "SecurITree is a multiplatform program that allows security professionals to diagram attack trees, which are branching sequences of events by which an attacker might achieve a specified negative goal. For example, a security professional might create an attack tree that specifies multiple methods by which an attacker could compromise a nuclear power plant.",
      "Each SecurITree attack tree contains a set of shapes connected by lines. The shapes contain text that details the steps in an attacker's assault. When a user saves a SecuriTree attack tree, it is saved as an RIT file.",
      "NOTE: RIT files may also contain images attached to the attack tree."
