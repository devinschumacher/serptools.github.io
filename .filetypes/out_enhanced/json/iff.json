      "IFF files are comprised of sections of data called \"chunks,\" which are defined by four-letter IDs. There are three main chunk types, each of which may contain text, numerical data, or raw data: FORM : specifies the format of the file LIST : includes the properties of the file CAT : contains the rest of the data The IFF format is also known as \"EA IFF 1985\" since Electronic Arts designed the file format in 1985.",
      "NOTE: IFF files used by The Sims and The Sims Online can be edited using IFF Snooper for the Mac platform or IFF Pencil for Windows."
