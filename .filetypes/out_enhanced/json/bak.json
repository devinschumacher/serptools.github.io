      "Many popular web browsers, including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, are based on Google's open-source Chromium browser. Chromium-based browsers save users' bookmarks in a file named Bookmarks . They also save a backup of users' bookmarks in Bookmarks.bak .",
      "If you use a Chromium-based browser, and your Bookmarks file becomes corrupt or goes missing, you can use your Bookmarks.bak file to restore your bookmarks and folders. To do so, first navigate to the directory that contains your Bookmarks and Bookmarks.bak file:",
      "Then, delete your previous Bookmarks file (if it appears). Finally, rename Bookmarks.bak to just Bookmarks . When you close and reopen your browser, the bookmarks your new Bookmarks file contains will appear."
