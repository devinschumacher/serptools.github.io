      "Bzip2 is a free file compression utility that compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler compression algorithm and Huffman encoding. After bzip2 compresses a file, it changes that file's name to filename.bz2 .",
      "Unlike .ZIP files and other compressed archives, BZ2 files only ever contain a single compressed file. However, you can use bzip2 to compress multiple files at once, which will create a series of BZ2 files."
