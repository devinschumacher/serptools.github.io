      "BSP stands for Binary Space Partitioning, which is a technique a game engine can use to break intricate polygons into convex sets. This allows the engine to render 3D maps more quickly. Every BSP file is made up of \"lumps,\" which are chunks of data defined in the file's header. These lumps include Entities, Nodes, Vertices, Planes, Leaves, Visibility, Faces, and Textures.",
      "BSP maps are compiled binary files. Developers can compile BSP files from .MAP files using tools such as Q3Map2 and Irrlicht. Developers can also create BSP files using id Software programs such as GtkRadiant and DarkRadiant.",
      "Quake game engines that use BSP files include id Tech 1 (Doom Engine), Quake Engine (the original Quake engine), id Tech 2 (Quake II Engine), id Tech 3 (used originally for Quake III Arena), and id Tech 4 (originally used for Doom 3).",
      "Since Valve's Source game engine (used to develop games such as Half-Life 2, Left 4 Dead, and Team Fortress 2) originated from the Quake engine, it also uses maps saved as BSP files. However, the Source engine's BSP file format differs slightly from the Quake engine's. As such, programs that can decompile Quake BSP files may not be able to decompile Source BSP files, and vice-versa.",
      "Source engine games' BSP files are stored in the games' .GCF archives. Notably, Source engine BSP files do not include the map's description text or the AI navigation file that non-player characters (NPCs) use to navigate the map."
