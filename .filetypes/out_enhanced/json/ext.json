      "If you receive an EXT file as an email attachment, it is generally not clear what the file format is. Therefore, it is best to contact the sender of the email to determine the file format.",
      "Many automated emailer code examples available on the Web use the generic string \"filename.ext\" when referring to the email attachment. Therefore, it's possible the script author did not replace the filename string with the appropriate attachment filename when sending the email."
