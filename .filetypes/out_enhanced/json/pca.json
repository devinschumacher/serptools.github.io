      "GRAPHISOFT Archicad is building information modeling (BIM) software that architects often use to design the appearance of structures, such as homes, office buildings, and hotels. The app enables you to work remotely with a team of other Archicad users via its BIMcloud storage space.",
      "Via BIMcloud, you can create a Teamwork Project that each team member can edit. You can also save a draft of the teamwork project as a PLC file on your local machine, allowing you to edit the draft, then send it to the teamwork project when ready. If you want to back up the draft or transfer it to another machine, save it as a PCA file."
