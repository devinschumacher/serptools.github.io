      "UltraTracker was primarily used by music producers and enthusiasts in the demoscene community to create compositions with short samples. The UWF format is a container for raw audio samples that UltraTracker users can loop, layer, or trigger at various pitches and tempos to create instrument-like sounds in their ULT compositions.",
      "NOTE: Since UltraTracker was discontinued, the UWF format has become obsolete."
