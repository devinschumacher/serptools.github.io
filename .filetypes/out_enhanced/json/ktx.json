      "When an iPhone or iPad user switches from one application to another, or returns to their home screen from an application, their device creates a KTX file. The KTX file is an exact copy of the user's screen at the time they switched applications. When the user switches back to a previously-opened application, their device first loads the KTX file it created as the user switched away. This provides the user with a smooth visual transition as their device finishes re-loading the actual application.",
      "Most iPhone and iPad users will never encounter a KTX file. However, those who have jailbroken their iOS device can find their device's KTX files in the following directories:",
      "KTX files are most commonly used by forensic investigators, who examine users' KTX files for evidence of what a user was doing at specific times. Because KTX users are typically hidden from users and cannot easily be deleted, investigators can jailbreak a user's iOS device and examine the device's KTX files for information about the user's activities.",
      "NOTE: Khronos Group released the Khronos Texture 2.0 (KTX2) format on April 20, 2021 to improve upon the KTX format. Textures saved in the KTX2 format are saved as .KTX2 files."
