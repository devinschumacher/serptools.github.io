      "The Music Animation Machine (MAM) is a musical score player developed by Stephen Malinowski. Malinowski developed MAM to show a score visually using colored bars that represent notes. This allows musicians to see the music's structure, including each note's pitch and timing.",
      "MAM saves musical scores in the MAMX format. Each MAMX file contains a header that defines the score metadata and lines of text that define the notes the score includes.",
      "To create MAMX files, musicians typically import an existing MIDI file into MAM and then save it in the MAMX format. Musicians can also create MAMX files by connecting their keyboard to MAM via a MIDI connection, playing a piece of music, and saving the resulting score in the MAMX format."
