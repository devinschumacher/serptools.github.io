      "SWZ files enable Flash Player animations to load more quickly. They also allow developers to use Runtime Shared Libraries (RSLs), which are SWZ files that are shared between Flash applications. This allows application file sizes to be smaller.",
      "You cannot directly open SWZ files with Adobe Flash Player. Instead, Flash Player references digitally-signed RSLs saved in SWZ files when opening linked .SWF applications supported by the RSLs.",
      "SWZ files offer some advantages over a traditional web browser cache, since they include a digital signature and can be reused outside of the domain from which they originated."
