      "GTA San Andreas and IV use several scripts that control how certain in-game characters and objects behave during story missions. RRR, or R3, files control how non-player-controlled vehicles move. They contain binary data that defines the path a vehicle takes through the game world, ignoring the game's physics and environment. Vehicles moving along these paths do not take damage when they collide with other objects.",
      "While most players will never encounter or need to manually edit a GTA game's RRR files, modders enjoy modifying the game's existing RRR scripts and creating custom RRR scripts of their own. For example, modders can use the Carrec.cs CLEO script to create their own RRR files and add them to a game. Then, they can execute the script to move a vehicle along the path they defined."
