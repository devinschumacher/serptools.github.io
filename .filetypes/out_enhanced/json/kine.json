      "In version 5, KineMaster began allowing users to export their video editing projects as KINE files. Each KINE file includes a project's KMPROJECT file, which defines how KineMaster loads the project, and all the media files used in that project. By exporting a project as a KINE file, KineMaster users can transfer projects from device to device, allowing them to edit projects across devices."
