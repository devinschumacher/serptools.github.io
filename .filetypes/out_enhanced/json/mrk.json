      "The Print Order file is typically saved in the /​MISC folder on digital camera media and is named AUTPRINT.MRK . Images that the MRK file contains print order information for are most likely saved in the /​IMAGE folder on the camera.",
      "MRK files are meant to be referenced by the service or printer printing the digital photos on the camera. They are not meant to be manually opened by a user. However, since the files are saved in a text format they can be opened and viewed with a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad or Apple TextEdit."
