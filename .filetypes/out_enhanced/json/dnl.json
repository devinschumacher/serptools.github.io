      "In the past, authors and publishers used DNAML DeskTop Author to create copy-protected eBooks (and other digital publications), which could be opened only by authorized users with DNL Reader. These eBooks were saved as DNL files.",
      "While most DNL files contain eBooks, some instead contain digital catalogs, presentations, cards, brochures, or photo albums. In some cases, authors and publishers packaged DNL files with DNL Reader in standalone Windows executable ( .EXE ) files, which users could simply double-click to read the publication the DNL file contained."
