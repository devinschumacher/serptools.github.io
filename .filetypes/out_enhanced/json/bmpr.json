      "Front-end developers, UI designers, and others can use Balsamiq Mockups to prototype the front-end design of a website or mobile app. Each Mockups project can include one or more wireframes showing, for example, different pages of a website or different screens of an app. These wireframes are comprised of images that simulate a device, such as an iPhone or Android phone, or a UI element, such as a button, menu, or logo.",
      "Users can save their Mockups projects as BMPR files. This allows them to return to their projects and continue editing them later. Users can also export any of the wireframes a BMPR file includes as a PDF or PNG file. To do so, they select File â†’ Export... from the program's menu bar.",
      "NOTE: Balsamiq Mockups projects were previously saved as .BMML files."
