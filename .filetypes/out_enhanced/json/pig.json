      "In Descent and Descent 2, players battle against an alien computer virus by destroying infected mines' power reactors. Interplay Productions and Parallax Software released the first Descent in 1995 for MS-DOS and Mac; they released Descent 2 in 1996.",
      "Both games store a variety of game assets in PIG files. Descent 2 stores additional textures in .POG files. Those textures replace some of the textures contained in Descent 2's PIG files."
