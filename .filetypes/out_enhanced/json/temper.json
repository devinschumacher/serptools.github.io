      "The Temper programming language aids in systems integration by allowing a small group of developers to define libraries and type definitions that can be shared across nodes in a distributed system regardless of the language(s) used to implement the node. Additionally, the language is designed to translate to other programming languages, which also helps with systems integration.",
      "NOTE: The Temper toolchain contributors develop the Temper programming language, which is not yet publicly released."
