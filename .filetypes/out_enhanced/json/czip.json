      "The ZipGenius Team (formerly WinInizio Software) develops ZipGenius. The Zip utility supports compressing and extracting various archive formats, including .ZIP , .CBZ , .TAR.GZ , .7Z , and .LZH .",
      "The CZIP format supports various options for compressing archives, including Standard, Self-locking, and Self-erasing types. Furthermore, you can only extract self-locking and self-erasing archives with the correct passphrase (three incorrect passwords renders the file unrecoverable). You can also add your name or email address and choose the archive version when compressing the CZIP archive.",
      "To create a CZIP file, select Tools â†’ Encrypt / decrypt archive . Depending on your chosen encryption method, you will encounter different prompts to create the CZIP file. For example, if you choose the Twofish method, you must enter a passphrase for securing the CZIP archive before creating it."
