      "While most video game players will never encounter NUS3AUDIO files, some Super Smash Bros. enthusiasts enjoy extracting, playing, modifying, and creating their own NUS3AUDIO files. These modders have developed programs that allow them to manipulate and create NUS3AUDIO files, so they can add custom music and dialogue to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.",
      "NOTE: The NUS3AUDIO format replaced the .NUS3BANK format used in Super Smash Bros. 4. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate contains NUS3BANK files, but those files are used only to set audio parameters, such as volume."
