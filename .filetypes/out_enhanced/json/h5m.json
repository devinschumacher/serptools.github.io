      "Heroes of Might and Magic V mapmakers often post their custom maps online, for other players to download and use. These custom maps, usually created using the game's Map Editor, are saved as H5M files. (Additionally, some mapmakers have recreated Heroes of Might and Magic V's default maps as H5M files, for archival purposes.)",
      "Players using a version of Heroes of Might and Magic V prior to 1.3 will not be able to install and use H5M files. Prior to version 1.3, players saved Heroes of Might and Magic V mods and custom maps as .PAK files.",
      "NOTE: In some cases, an H5M file may instead contain a Heroes of Might and Magic V mod. Most mods, however, are saved as .H5U files."
