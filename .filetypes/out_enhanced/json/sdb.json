When saving an SDB file, SAP2000 automatically creates SBK binary backup files and $2K text backup files in the same directory as the SDB file. SAP2000 also saves temporary tables, viewpoints, and other related files in the same directory as the SDB file. Do not delete these files, as the SDB file may reference them.",
