      "Affinity Photo is an alternative to Adobe Photoshop that professional photographers and other digital artists utilize to modify photographs and create images. Just as Photoshop saves users' in-progress images as .PSD files, Affinity Photo saves in-progress images in AFPHOTO files.",
      "To create an AFPHOTO with the Windows and Mac versions of Affinity Photo, select File → New... , modify the image, then select File → Save or Save As . After saving your progress as an AFPHOTO file, you can close it and re-open it for further editing."
