      "Cowabunga is an iOS systems setting manager that uses the MacDirtyCow expolit to allow users to customize their iOS settings. It works with iOS 14.0 to 15.7.1 and 16.0 to 16.1.2.",
      "For example, with Cowabunga, a user can customize their phone's lock screen buttons, hide certain menu buttons and icons, and change the text that appears on their phone's screens and menus. The app also allows users to create custom operations that edit .PLIST values, replace a system file, or disable a system file. These custom operations are saved as COWPERATION files, and users can export them to back them up or share them with other users."
