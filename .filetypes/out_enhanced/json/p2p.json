      "FolderShare was acquired by Microsoft in 2005. It allowed users to access information across various devices. By double-clicking a P2P file within FolderShare, a file on a different device would be downloaded to your computer. FolderShare was replaced by Windows Live Sync.",
      "NOTE: The term \" P2P \" is also short for \"peer-to-peer,\" which refers to Internet file sharing programs. Most P2P programs do not use the \".p2p\" file extension."
