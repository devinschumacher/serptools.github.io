      "Effekseer is a free cross-platform application for creating animated particle effects, such as light emissions, lasers, or explosions. Most Effekseer users illustrate particle animations with the application to import them into 2D and 3D games or to share fun effects online.",
      "The EFKPKG format allows users to package together their Effekseer files in one file, making it easier to transfer them to be imported into Effekseer by another user. To create an EFKPKG file, select Files → Export → Effekseer package ."
