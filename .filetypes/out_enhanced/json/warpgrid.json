      "Paint.NET is a free image editing program available for Windows. It allows users to edit images using layer-based tools and special effects.",
      "The Paint.NET community has created a variety of plug-ins that add additional features to the program. One such set of plug-ins, created by user pyrochild, includes a tool called Grid Warp. Grid Warp allows Paint.NET users to warp an image using an overlaid grid. The grid contains several points, which users can move to distort the image.",
      "If a user wants to save a grid they've created in Grid Warp, so they can apply that grid's distortion effect to another image, they can do so by selecting the Save button that appears in the Grid Warp window. This saves the grid as a WARPGRID file."
