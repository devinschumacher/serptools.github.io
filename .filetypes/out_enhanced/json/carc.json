      "CARC files can be extracted from .NDS files using NarcTool, Taxahan, or another Nintendo DS ROM editor. From here, they can be decompressed to NARC files, which can be browsed and edited with tools such as Narc Explorer.",
      "NOTE: While CARC files are rarely included with Wii games, they are used by the Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort games."
