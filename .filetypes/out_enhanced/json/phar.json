      "PHAR files are similar to Java's .JAR files and can be run using PHP. An example of a common PHP application that is distributed as a PHAR archive is PEAR (PHP Extension and Application Repository), a package manager for PHP extensions.",
      "PHP Archive files are compatible with APC (Alternative PHP Cache), an \"opcode cache\" that optimizes application performance by caching the compiled versions of code. phpMyAdmin, a commonly-used front end for MySQL, has been measured with a 6x speedup when run as a PHAR file.",
      "NOTE: Phar, the PHP component that reads and writes PHAR files, is included with PHP 5.3."
