      "3GPP is a multimedia container format based on the ISO media file format. The format is commonly used by 3G mobile phones that support video capture but may also be played on various 2G and 4G phones.",
      "The format stores video streams as H.263 or H.264 and audio streams as AMR-WB, AMR-WB+, AMR-NB, HE-AAC v1, AAC-LC, or Enhanced aacPlus. 3GPP is still used but has been dropped by many mobile devices as more efficient video formats have emerged.",
      "NOTE: 3GPP files more commonly use the .3GP extension."
