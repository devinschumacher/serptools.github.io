      "Gel electrophoresis is used to separate and analyze macromolecules, such as DNA and RNA, and their fragments. GeneSnap is developed as an advanced image acquisition program for scientists that enables them to capture, archive, and manipulate electrophoretic gel images. It is included in every Syngene gel documentation and analysis system.",
      "Along with the SGD format, GeneSnap allows you to export data to the uncompressed TIFF or BMP formats and the JPEG, GIF, TGA, PCX, and WPG formats. You can double-click the SGD file to open it or select Open in the File menu.",
      "NOTE: Syngene discontinued GeneSnap."
