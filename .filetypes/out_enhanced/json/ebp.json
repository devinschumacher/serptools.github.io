      "Express Burn is a disc-burning software that allows users to store their audio, video, and other files on CDs , DVDs , or Blu-ray discs. As users assemble the list of files they want to burn to a disc, they can save that list as an Express Burn Project, or EBP file.",
      "An EBP file consists of XML-formatted text that refers to the folders and files a user intends to burn to a disc. It does not, however, actually contain those files. So if, for example, a user were to move a video referenced in an EBP file before attempting to burn the video to a disc, Express Burn would fail to burn the video to the disc, because the video is no longer located in the referenced location."
