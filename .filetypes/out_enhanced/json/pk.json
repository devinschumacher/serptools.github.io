      "By default, peak files are generated for all audio files opened in Audition 2.0. This speeds up the waveform display process since the waveform only needs to be generated the first time. You may turn off the automatic peak file generation by choosing Edit → Preferences → Display , then deselecting Save Peak Cache Files .",
      "NOTE: Adobe acquired Syntrillium in May 2003 and rebranded the program Cool Edit Pro as Adobe Audition."
