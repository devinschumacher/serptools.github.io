      "Photoshop users save projects as PSB files when working with large graphics, such as detailed print layouts, 3D compositions, or high-resolution digital artwork, that require more space than the PSD format allows. The PSB format supports images up to 300,000 x 300,000 pixels, the maximum image size Photoshop permits. Adobe designed the format to maintain full editing capabilities on oversized projects without losing detail or structural data.",
      "Although PSB files are nearly identical to PSD files in terms of structure and functionality, they are not widely supported outside Adobe software. Most third-party image editors do not support PSB files, so using them in workflows that rely primarily on Adobe Photoshop is best."
