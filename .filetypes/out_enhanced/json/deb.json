      "Debian, Ubuntu, and other supported Linux distribution users install and manage DEB files using either the Debian package management system (dpkg) or APT package management software. Users can also decompress DEB files to view their contents before installation. The TAR archives that DEB files contain are commonly compressed using bzip or gzip compression.",
      "Some Debian packages are available as .UDEB files, which are also known as udebs or \"micro debs.\" UDEB files are structured similarly to DEB files, but they contain only the essential files a program needs to function."
