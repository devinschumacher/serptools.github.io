      "Professional animators use Toon Boom Harmony to draw, paint, and animate 2D animations. Harmony is available in three different versions: Essentials, Advanced, and Premium.",
      "All versions of Harmony save animation projects in directories that include an XSTAGE file. Each XSTAGE file stores the information needed to load the project's frames and elements in Harmony. It also defines the project's intended resolution, aspect ratio, and frame rate, and it states the version of Harmony that created the file.",
      "In some versions of Harmony, users can save different versions of the same scene in additional XSTAGE files. Therefore, you may see slightly differently-named XSTAGE files that contain a slightly different version of the same scene.",
      "NOTE: Harmony often creates backup project files that use the .xstage~ extension."
