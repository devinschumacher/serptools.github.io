      "BIT files are created by FinalCrypt and can only be opened by FinalCrypt using the key file used to encrypt the BIT file. Data in a BIT cannot be recovered without the key file, so it is important that it is stored in a safe location and backed up.",
      "Although BIT files are encrypted, they still can be identified by the first 70 bytes in the file. This data is the Message Authentication Code (MAC), which is saved in plain text and may be saved in MAC_V1 or MAC_V2 version."
