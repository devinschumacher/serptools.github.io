      "G64X files are created when you export video recorded by a surveillance camera using the Genetec Security Center software. When exporting the video, you can choose to export it in the G64X or .G64 (older format replaced by G64X) formats or the more popular .MP4 or .ASF video file formats.",
      "NOTE: The Genetec Video Player is an application that can be installed on other machines that don't have Security Center software in order to play the G64X video file."
