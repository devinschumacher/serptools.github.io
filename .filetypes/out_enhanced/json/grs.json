      "Gravity Sketch is a 3D drawing and model creation tool that allows users to create loose sketches, detailed models, and fully-realized scenes. Most users access Gravity Sketch using a VR headset and controllers, which allow the user to draw, place, and edit objects as though they were standing among them.",
      "Users can save finished or in-progress Gravity Sketch models as GRS files. In addition to being able to open GRS files from Gravity Sketch's main menu, users can import GRS files into another Gravity Sketch project. This allows a user to add a previously-completed model to a new project. Users can also export GRS files as .OBJ , .IGES , or .FBX files, to view and edit the models they contain in more typical desktop 3D modeling programs."
