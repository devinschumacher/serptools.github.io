      "PC Building Simulator is a video game that allows PC enthusiasts to simulate building real-life PCs, using virtual versions of real PC parts. The game includes a Career mode, in which players run a PC repair shop and attempt to keep the shop afloat, and a Free Build mode, in which players have unlimited money, PC parts, and tools with which to construct PCs.",
      "Players can save their progress in either mode. When they do, PC Building Simulator creates a BINARY file to store the player's progress. The game stores BINARY files in its Saves directory."
