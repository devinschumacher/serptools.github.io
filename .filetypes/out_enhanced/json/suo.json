      "If you are a developer, you do not need to store SUO files under version control (e.g., Git or Subversion) since these files are specific to your machine and Visual Studio installation. Additionally, since SUO files change each time you use an associated Visual Studio solution ( .SLN ) and they are saved in a binary format, they become difficult to place under version control."
