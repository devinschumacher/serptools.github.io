      "ESRI ArcGIS is a mapping application for the Windows platform that allows you to create, share, and manage geographic maps, data, and analytical models. When you save a map in ArcGIS, the software creates an MXD file to store the contents.",
      "NOTE: MXD map files may grow in size after being saved multiple times because they can become fragmented. If you save a fragmented map document as a new document, it may reduce its file size."
