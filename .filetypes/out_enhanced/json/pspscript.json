      "Since PSPSCRIPT files can be used to store various types of resources, the file name preceding the extension typically indicates the type of resource the file contains (e.g., brushtip.pspscript or swatch.pspscript ). Also, you can typically identify the type of resource in the PSPSCRIPT file by the name of the folder storing the file.",
      "You can share PSPSCRIPT files with other users simply by attaching them to an email, uploading them to an online storage space, or transferring them to a flash drive. After receiving the PSPSCRIPT file, the user can import it into Paint Shop Pro or save the file to the following directory:",
