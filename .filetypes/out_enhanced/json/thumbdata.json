      "THUMBDATA files are hidden files, which are stored in Android devices' hidden .THUMBNAILS folders. As such, you can access your device's THUMBDATA files only if you have access to hidden Android files. The files' extensions typically end with a number followed by one or two dashes and an additional long string of numbers. For example, a THUMBDATA file may be named .THUMBDATA3--1967290299 .",
      "If a THUMBDATA file is taking up too much space on your Android device, you can safely delete the file. The next time you open the Gallery app, it will automatically create a new THUMBDATA file, which will contain indexed property information for only the images currently stored on your device. If you've recently deleted images from your device, this will reduce the size of your THUMBDATA file.",
      "If you want to stop your device from creating THUMBDATA files altogether, you can:",
      "This will stop your Gallery app from creating a new THUMBDATA file. Note that Gallery may load thumbnails more slowly if you prevent it from creating a THUMBDATA file."
