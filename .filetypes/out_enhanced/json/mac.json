      "MacPaint was a digital drawing application released alongside the original Macintosh. It allowed users to create black-and-white graphics, which they could then export and use in other applications (such as MacWrite, a word processor for the original Macintosh).",
      "Images created by MacPaint were saved in a proprietary format, often referred to as the MacPaint image format. While most images created by MacPaint were saved with the .PNTG extension, others were saved as MAC or .PIC files.",
      "NOTE: The images that MAC files contain are always 576 x 720 pixels."
