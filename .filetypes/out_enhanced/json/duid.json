      "In version 6 of DHCP, both clients and servers are assigned DHCP Unique Identifiers (DUIDs). Devices use these IDs to identify themselves when connecting over a network that uses the DHCPv6 protocol. Servers can also use a client's DUID to pass options to only that client or prohibit that client from receiving any parameters.",
      "NOTE: A device's DUID is sometimes saved in a file whose name ends in duid and does not include a file extension."
