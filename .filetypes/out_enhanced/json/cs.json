      "Developers utilize C# for building applications that run in the .NET ecosystem, which is a software framework that provides a standard method for building and deploying applications (primarily in Windows). The programming language is component-oriented, and some of its features include nullable types, exception handling, garbage collection, lambda expressions, asynchronous operations, and Language Integrated Query (LINQ) syntax . It also is flexible (through versioning) to ensure compatibility as technologies evolve.",
      "Microsoft developed C# in 2000, and Ecma approved it as an international standard in 2002. It was originally released with .NET Framework 1.0 and included with Visual Studio .NET 2002.",
      "Throughout the years, Microsoft has released numerous versions of C# with .NET Framework and Visual Studio. Some notable releases:",
      "NOTE: When C# programs are compiled, they can then be run by the Common Language Runtime (CLR) included with the .NET Framework."
