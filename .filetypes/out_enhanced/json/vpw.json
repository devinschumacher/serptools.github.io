      "When you save your recordings in VoxPro, the default file type is VPW, which will create a VPW file. You can easily create a .WAV file from your VPW file by simply renaming the extension to WAV. It will not sound the same as your VPW file though, it will play the original audio then it will play any effects or audio pasted from other files.",
      "NOTE: Audion Labs was acquired by Wheatstone Corporation."
