      "Dennis Ritchie originally developed the C programming language to create Unix utilities in Bell Labs in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Since the 1970s, the popularity of C has grown, and many users have learned and used the language to develop operating systems, database management systems, games, and more. In addition, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) have also standardized the C programming language since 1989.",
      "The language has also influenced many programming languages, including C++, PHP, Perl, Python, Java, and JavaScript. For example, C++ is an extension of the C programming language and was released in the mid-1980s. Developers use the language to create many of today's software programs. The C++ language may be stored in C, .CC , .CPP , .CXX , and C++ source code files."
