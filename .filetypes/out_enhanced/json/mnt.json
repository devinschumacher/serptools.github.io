      "While MNT and MNX files are closely related, the MNX file stores the structure of the main menu, and the MNT file is a support file that does not directly affect menu functionality. Developers typically access and update MNT memos when modifying or reviewing the interface menus of an application.",
      "NOTE: The last version of Visual FoxPro was 9.0, which Microsoft published in 2007."
