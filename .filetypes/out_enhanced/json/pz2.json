      "Other types of pose files can be used to alter scenes, not just figure poses. Two examples include 1) MAT poses, which are applied to image maps and surface materials, and 2) injection morph files, which can morph figures in a scene.",
      "NOTE: Poser was originally developed by Smith Micro, but was sold to Bondware in June 2019."
