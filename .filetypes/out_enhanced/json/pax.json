      "Sometimes the \".pax\" extension is used as an alternative to the .TAR and .CPIO formats, since there were differences that evolved between the two formats as they were developed. In this manner, the pax utility can handle both formats transparently while the file extension remains neutral.",
      "NOTE: The \".pax\" extension is not commonly used. Instead, archives used by pax usually retain their original extensions, such as \".tar\" or \".cpio.\" By default, pax creates archives in the ustar format."
