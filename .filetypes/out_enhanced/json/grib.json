      "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) maintains and updates the GRIB format to stay relevant for modern meteorology and climate science forecasting needs. There are two main versions of the format: GRIB1 and GRIB2 . GRIB2 is the newer version, offering better compression and more detailed metadata , making it the preferred format for many agencies, including National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).",
      "NOTE: GRIB files are more commonly saved with the .grb extension ( .GRB file)."
