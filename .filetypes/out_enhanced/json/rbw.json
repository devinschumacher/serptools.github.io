      "NOTE: Using both \".rb\" and \".rbw\" extensions during development enables you to set different file associations for performing different default tasks. For example, you might assign the \".rb\" extension to one Ruby interpreter while setting the \".rbw\" extension association to another. Alternatively, you could set one for an interpreter while setting another to open in a text editor."
