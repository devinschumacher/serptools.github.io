      "The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) created the DICOM format. NEMA released the initial standard in 1983 and revised it several times in the 1990s and 2000s.",
      "The format has become a standard for storing, transmitting, viewing, processing, and printing medical images, such as MRIs, CT scans, and ultrasound images. In addition, doctors often share images with other medical professionals and their patients via CDs or email.",
      "NOTE: DCM files may also be saved as .DICOM files."
