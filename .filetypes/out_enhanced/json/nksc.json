      "Nikon digital camera users can download and use Nikon Capture NX-D to process the RAW images their camera produces. When a user makes one or more edits to an image in Capture NX-D, a record of those edits is automatically saved as an NKSC, or Nikon sidecar, file.",
      "Saving a user's edits in an NKSC file, rather than applying them directly to the user's NEF or NRW file, allows the user to retain their original image and to revert to the original image in Capture NX-D if needed. To revert to your original image in Capture NX-D, click the Restore button located on the app's right-hand side."
