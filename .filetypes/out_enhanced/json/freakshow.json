      "Freakshow Industries produces plug-ins used to add features to many Digital Audio Workstations ( DAWs ), including Avid Pro Tools, Steinberg Cubase, Apple Logic Pro, Ableton Live, and Cockos REAPER. These plug-ins are available for purchase on Freakshow Industries' website. Users can also \"steal\" the plug-ins, which provides them with the full version of the plug-in for free, with limitations on upgrades and support.",
      "When a user purchases or \"steals\" a plug-in, they are provided with a license file used to activate the plug-in. These files use the .freakshow extension. Users can download their FREAKSHOW files from their Freakshow Industries account page. They can then use them to activate associated plug-ins."
