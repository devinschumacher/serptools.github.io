      "MakeMusic Finale is a scorewriting program that composers use to create, edit, and listen to musical scores. For example, a composer might create an original composition, add lyrics to the song, and then play the song back via their computer's speakers to hear how it sounds.",

      "NOTE: Finale 2014 and later versions save scores as .MUSX files."
