      "Bethesda encourages Oblivion, Skyrim, and Fallout 4 players to mod the games if they so desire. To that end, the games each feature the ability to load additional content stored in ESP files. Players can also modify the games using the following file types:",
      "As the games load, they first load the data contained in their ESM master files. Then, they apply any game modification data you've added in the form of ESP files. This allows the ESP files to override the games' default data and behavior."
