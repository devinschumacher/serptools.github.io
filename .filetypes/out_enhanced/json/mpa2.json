      "Some video recorders save video and audio in separate files. This allows moviemakers to import and edit these files separately while creating movies. In some instances, audio and video encoded using the MPEG codec may be saved as MPA2 and MPV2 files, respectively.",
      "However, the .mpa2 extension is uncommon. More commonly, audio files encoded using MPEG-1 Layer II audio encoding are saved with the .MP2 or .M2A extension."
