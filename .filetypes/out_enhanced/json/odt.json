      "OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) released the ODT format in 2005 as part of the OpenDocument Format (ODF) 1.0 specification. The organization developed ODT to provide an open, XML-based alternative to proprietary document formats like Microsoft Word's .DOC and DOCX.",
      "Since its release, the ODF standard has undergone several updates, with the latest version being ODF 1.3, published in 2021. The ODT format remains widely used in LibreOffice Writer and Apache OpenOffice Writer among users (often students) who prefer free, open-source software over commercial alternatives like Microsoft Word .",
      "ODT files conform to the OpenDocument standard maintained by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS). They are ZIP-compressed archives that contain XML-based document structure and content files, along with embedded media and style information."
