      "Flatpak is a Linux app distribution framework that allows developers to easily package and distribute applications across multiple Linux platforms. Flatpak also makes it easier for developers to fix and maintain their applications, as they do not have to develop and publish different versions of their applications for different Linux platforms.",
      "After a developer finishes packaging an app using Flatpak, they create a repository that contains all the application's code. They then upload the repository to the Internet and create a FLATPAKREPO file that contains all the information Linux users need to access the repository.",
      "Users who prefer to compile and install apps themselves can download app repositories using the app's FLATPAKREPO files, while those who prefer to let Flatpak install apps for them can install the app using its .FLATPAKREF file, which contains a reference to its FLATPAKREPO file."
