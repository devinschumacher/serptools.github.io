      "Carl Bunton developed the BH algorithm in the 1990s and made it available with ZipTV, a suite of compression components for app developers to help them securely archive and store backups. BH shares similarities with Zip compression and supports encryption.",
      "While ZipTV is discontinued, other compression utilities, notably ConeXware PowerArchiver (Windows version only), still support the format. Additionally, non-developers may compress their files as BH archives even though it was originally intended for app developers. To create a BH archive with PowerArchiver: Select File → New → New Archive Choose the item(s) you want to compress Select the BlakHole option from the \"Save as type\" dropdown menu Click Save"
