      "Blazor is a .NET framework that developers can use to build interactive client-side web UIs. Notably, Blazor allows developers to develop UI components using C# instead of JavaScript and to share server-side and client-side app logic written in .NET.",
      "Developers build Blazor applications using Razor components, which are source code files written using Razor syntax and saved using the .razor extension. Razor syntax allows developers to efficiently combine HTML markup with C# code in the same source code file, to create dynamic web content. A Razor component defines a piece of a Blazor app's UI, such as a webpage, dialog box, or data entry form.",
      "One easy way to recognize a RAZOR file is to look for @ symbols that precede Razor directives and code blocks. For example, Razor uses the @page directive to specify a component's relative URL, and it uses the @if directive to control when code runs. RAZOR files use the @ symbol and reserved directives to transition from HTML markup to C# code.",
      "NOTE: Non-Blazor files that use Razor syntax are saved as .CSHTML files."
