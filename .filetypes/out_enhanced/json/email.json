      "You will most likely not come across an EMAIL file since the program (Microsoft Outlook Express) that uses the file has been discontinued. Also, EMAIL files are an an obscure alternative to the much more common .EML file. However, if you find the EML file and need to open it, you can use Microsoft Outlook Express. If you cannot find a copy of Outlook Express you can use a text editor to view the parts of the EML file that are stored in text."
