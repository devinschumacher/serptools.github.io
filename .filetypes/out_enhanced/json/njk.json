      "Nunjucks is a JavaScript template engine that web developers use to create web applications. The Nunjucks engine processes Nunjucks templates, alongside one or more associated data sources, to create resulting JavaScript webpages and apps. Each Nunjucks template is saved as an NJK file.",
      "NJK files are comprised of text written using the Nunjucks templating language. This language's syntax is similar to that of Python and Django. Nunjucks itself is heavily inspired by Jinja, whose templates use a similar syntax and design."
