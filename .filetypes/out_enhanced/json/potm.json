      "The average PowerPoint user will likely never come across a POTM file because it saves templates with more functionality than a typical user needs. For example, it supports macros, which are script -like functions that automate repetitive tasks.",
      "You can record macros in PowerPoint that can be replayed to complete a task and assign them to a button in PowerPoint or keystroke, which allows you to conveniently run the series of steps. To record a macro, select View â†’ Macros .",
      "If you are simply looking to create presentations, you can save them as .PPTX files, or as presentation template .POTX files. However, if you want to create a template that supports macros, you can save your presentation as a POTM file.",
      "NOTE: Microsoft introduced POTM files when it released Microsoft Office 2007."
