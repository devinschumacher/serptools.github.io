      "You can safely delete JBF files. However, Paint Shop Pro will recreate them the next time you use the image browser unless you turn off the option to store cached images on the hard drive. JBF files are commonly saved with the name pspbrwse.jbf .",
      "JBF files may become very large depending on the number of images that are browsed.",
      "NOTE: JBF files are used by some older versions of PSP. PSP is now called PaintShop Photo Pro."
