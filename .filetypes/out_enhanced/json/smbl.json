      "You most likely will only encounter an SMBL file if you play Super Meat Boy in Windows and are navigating the data files in the game installation directory. The files are typically not opened by gamers since they are referenced by the game to load information about playable levels in the game. However, gamers may also create, open, and modify SMBL files using the Level Editor included with the Steam version of Super Meat Boy.",
