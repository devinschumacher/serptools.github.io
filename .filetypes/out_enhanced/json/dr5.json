      "DR5 files are also used to store templates. These are helpful if you do not want to start from scratch and you want to re-use story elements from the template. To begin from a template, select File → New Document from Template... .",
      "Dramatica Story Expert is the macOS version of Dramatica Pro, which is only available for Windows.
