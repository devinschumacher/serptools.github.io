      "Microsoft introduced the PowerPoint Open XML Presentation format with the release of Microsoft PowerPoint 2007. Since the introduction of the format, PPTX files have become one of the most common file types for saving presentations.",
      "PPTX files have replaced .PPT files as the standard file format for saving presentations in PowerPoint. Unlike PPT files, which store presentation data in a single binary file, PPTX files are saved in the Open XML format, which stores data as separate files and folders in a compressed Zip package. The archive includes various types of files, such as an .XML file that stores presentation properties, one or more .TXT files that contain slide notes, and images and other media files that are included in the presentation.",
      "NOTE: You can explore the contents of a PPTX file by renaming the .pptx extension to .zip and decompressing the file with any Zip utility."
