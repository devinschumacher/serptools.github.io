      "FAST5 files are HDF5 ( .HDF ) files that store raw current-signal data recorded using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) devices. The format includes limitations that, among other things, prevent efficient parallel analysis. To overcome these limitations, Hasindu Gamaarachchi and others developed the SLOW5 and BLOW5 formats.",
      "SLOW5 is an ASCII format that stores a FAST5 file's data in plain text. BLOW5 is the binary version of SLOW5. BLOW5 files can be compressed using a variety of compression algorithms, further minimizing their file size. Both formats can be randomly accessed using accompanying index files, which use the .slow5.idx and .blow5.idx extensions."
