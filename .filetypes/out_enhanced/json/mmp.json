      "DJs use MixMeister Fusion (and other MixMeister software) to create professional-level mixes, using imported audio and various mixing effects. Prior to a performance, a DJ can create a preset playlist of songs they plan to play during that performance. They can then save and load this playlist as an MMP file.",
      "However, MMP files are not audio files, and they do not actually contain a copy of the songs a DJ added to a playlist. Instead, they contain references that allow MixMeister Fusion to load songs from wherever they reside on a DJ's computer. Thus, if a DJ moves a song they added to a MixMeister playlist, MixMeister will not be able to play that song as part of the playlist."
