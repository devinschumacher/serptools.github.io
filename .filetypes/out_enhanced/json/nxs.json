      "Nexus is a collection of tools used to convert large 3D models to the NXS format, edit NXS files, and view NXS files. Notably, converting a model to the NXS format allows users to view the model at different resolutions , optimized for their (GPU's|gpu) resources. This makes it easier for users to view large, graphics-intensive 3D models.",
      "The Nexus toolset is compatible with the OpenGL graphics API . This allows developers to include and show NXS models in programs that use the OpenGL API."
