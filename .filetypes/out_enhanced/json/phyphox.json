      "Phyphox is a mobile application that allows you to perform scientific experiments using your smartphone, tablet, or other mobile device's sensors (such as its accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS). The program includes several preset experiments you can perform using your device. Advanced users can create their own phyphox experiments using the program's accompanying Experiment Editor. These experiments are saved as PHYPHOX files.",
      "Each PHYPHOX file is an XML file that contains up to 10 blocks of information. These blocks define the experiment's title, the version of phyphox it is meant to be used with, its inputs, outputs, and views, any network connections required to perform the experiment, and all other experiment-related data."
