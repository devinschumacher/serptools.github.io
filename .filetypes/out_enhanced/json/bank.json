      "FMOD Studio can be used to develop games for various platforms, such as Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Wii U, mobile, and desktop. The program can be used with a variety of game engines, such as Unity, CryEngine, Valve Source, and Unreal Engine.",
      "FMOD Studio replaced FMOD Designer, which used .FSB files to store audio banks. FSB files were created with .FEV files, which contained the audio event metadata used by the game program code to trigger sounds when the game is being played."
