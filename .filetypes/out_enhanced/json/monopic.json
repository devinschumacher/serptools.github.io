      "Monodraw is a drawing tool available for macOS. It allows you to create diagrams, mind maps, banners, and art out of plain text elements. For example, you can create workflow diagrams comprised of plain text rectangles, text, arrows, and other elements. You can also add colors and embedded images to the drawings you create.",
      "The program saves art creation projects as MONOPIC files. These files are not plain text files. They are binary files that you can open only in Monodraw. After you finish creating an image in Monodraw, you can export that image in the .TXT , .PNG , or .SVG format to view and use it outside Monodraw."
