      "Nikon photographers are the most common users of NEF files. These photographers, who may be professionals or amateurs, capture images with their Nikon cameras and save the raw data in NEF files.",
      "The NEF format supports 12-bit or 14-bit data, depending on the camera used to capture the image. Any adjustments to image settings such as exposure, hue, tone, sharpening, and white balance can be applied with photo editing software once the image is saved to a computer.",
      "Changes to the image are stored as instruction sets separate from the raw image data in the NEF file. This means that no matter how many edits are applied to the image you can revert back to the original."
