      "Graphic designers primarily utilize Dimension to design photorealistic mockups and product visualizations. When saving a 3D scene with Dimension, the application creates a DN file to store the contents. The DN files are working files, which means that they can be modified in Dimension, saved, closed, then reopened in Dimension for further editing.",
      "NOTE: To create a DN file in Adobe Dimension, select File → New or New with Settings... , modify the 3D scene, then select File → Save... or Save As... ."
