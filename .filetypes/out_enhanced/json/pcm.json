      "The PCM format preserves audio fidelity by recording the full range of frequencies without losing quality due to compression. Since PCM files store high-quality audio, music production and sound design professionals often work with them (PCM was integral to the CD audio standard developed by Philips and Sony).",
      "Additionally, PCM files are raw and do not include metadata , such as track details or playback configurations, making them potentially difficult for average users to play accurately. To simplify playback, users often package PCM data within container formats like .WAV or .AIFF to include necessary metadata."
