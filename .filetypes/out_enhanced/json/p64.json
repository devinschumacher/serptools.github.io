      "The P64 files are loadable libraries, similar to .DLL , that extends IDA's disassembling capabilities, such as the improvement of the analysis of Microsoft binaries with public debugging symbols. The P64 plugin should be placed in the /​plugin/​p64/​ directory.",
      "NOTE: Each IDA plugin uses a different extension depending on its operating system type. The .PLW extension is used for Windows 32-bit, the .PLX extension is used by Linux 32-bit, and the .PLX64 extension is used by Linux 64-bit plugins."
