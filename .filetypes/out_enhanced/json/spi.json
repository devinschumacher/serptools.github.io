      "StorageCraft ShadowProtect is a program system administrators can use to back up the current state and contents of a computer's hard drive, or hard disk. ShadowProtect saves backup disk images as SPF and SPI files.",
      "An SPF file contains the entirety of a disk's contents at the time it was initially backed up. SPI files contain only the changes made to a disk since the last time it was backed up. The changes an SPI file contains are referred to as an incremental backup.",
      "Incremental backups can be used to restore a disk to its state at the time the incremental backup was created. However, they must be combined with an SPF file and, sometimes, other SPI files to do so. For example, if you created an SPF backup and two SPI incremental backups, and you wanted to restore your system to its state at the time you created the second incremental backup, you would need your SPF file and both SPI files. ShadowProtect could then apply the changes saved in both SPI files to your SPF file as it restored your system."
