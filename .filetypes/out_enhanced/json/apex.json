      "The APEX format helps streamline Android security updates deployed to Android devices. For example, instead of waiting to publish a full system upgrade, a device manufacturer can update an individual library to apply a patch or add a system feature. To distribute an APEX file, publishers can use the APEX manager (apexd) or the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) tool.",
      "The structure of an APEX files is as follows:",
      "Since APEX files are saved in a compressed .ZIP format, they can be opened by any Zip decompression tool. Therefore, if you would like to explore the contents of an APEX file, you can rename the file extension to .zip and open the ZIP file with a Zip-decompression utility, such as Microsoft File Explorer, Apple Archive Utility, or Corel WinZip."
