      "Bus Simulator Indonesia, also known as BUSSID, is a mobile game in which players drive a bus across Indonesia. The game enjoys a healthy modding scene, which creates vehicle customization mods saved in BUSSIDMOD files. Modders then share their BUSSIDMOD files online.",
      "Other players may download a BUSSIDMOD file from a BUSSID-related forum or a file-sharing website. Sometimes, these BUSSIDMOD files are packaged in .ZIP or otherwise-compressed archives. To retrieve their BUSSIDMOD file, players must first decompress the archive in which it is stored."
