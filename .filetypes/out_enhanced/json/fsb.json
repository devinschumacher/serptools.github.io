      "Firelight Technologies FMOD Designer was a program that video game developers and sound designers used to create and package sounds for use in console and PC games. After a user finished designing their game's sounds, they would package those sounds in a single FSB archive. They could then integrate the archive, and accompanying audio event data saved in an FEV file, into their game.",
      "NOTE: FMOD Designer has been replaced by FMOD Studio, which uses .BANK files instead of FSB files."
