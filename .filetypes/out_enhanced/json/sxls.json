      "SealedMedia was the original creators of the \"sealed\" file type but they were acquired by Oracle. The company previously provided an application called SealedMedia Unsealer, which would unseal documents. However, this program is no longer available.",
      "SXLS files can be viewed with the Oracle IRM Desktop software, which facilitates the authorization rights management for the digital documents. Oracle IRM software sometimes integrates with common business applications such as Microsoft Office or Lotus Notes. With this setup, SXLS files appear as normal XLS files to the end user, but there may be an additional option \"seal\" a file. The integrated IRM software then facilitates the hosting, transfer, and authorization rights management behind the scenes.",
      "NOTE: Oracle IRM Desktop adds an \"s\" to the beginning of the file extension it is sealing. For example, .TXT files sealed by IRM become .STXT files."
