      "POTX files are saved in the Open XML standard format, which was introduced in Microsoft Office 2007. They replaced .POT files, which were saved in a binary format and used by PowerPoint 97 through 2003.",
      "POTX files come installed with PowerPoint allowing you to create presentations from professionally designed templates. You may also create your own custom templates to reproduce presentations specific to your needs. POTX files are commonly created by companies with a standard master slide, company logos, and company headers and footers."
