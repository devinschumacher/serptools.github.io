      "Taikojiro is a rhythm game in which players press buttons in time to music, attempting to synchronize their button presses with on-screen prompts. TJA files describe when prompts appear on-screen during a song.",
      "TJA files are plain text files that contain a variety of metadata and hexadecimal data that determines when prompts appear. The metadata that TJA files contain includes:",
      "Each TJA file must be stored alongside the audio file it is meant to be used with. When players load a song in Taikojiro and related games, they actually load the folder that contains the TJA file and its accompanying song, not the TJA file itself."
