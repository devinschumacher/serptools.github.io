      "BookBuddi is a \"talking eReader\" that can both display an eBook's contents and read the book's text aloud to a listener. This allows BookBuddi users to either read or listen to an eBook's contents, depending on their preference.",
      "Each BookBuddi eBook is saved as a BKK file. This file contains binary data that BookBuddi uses to display a book's text and pictures, as well as read the book's contents aloud. Most BKK files contain a children's story, such as Alice in Wonderland, The Princess and the Pea, or The Little Mermaid."
