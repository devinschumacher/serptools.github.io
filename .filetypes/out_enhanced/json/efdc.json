      "In September 2021, some PC users began reporting their computers had been infected by a new variant of STOP ransomware. This variant encrypts users' files and appends them with the .efdc extension. The ransomware then produces a plain text ransom note named _readme.txt in every folder that contains an infected file. The note contains instructions users are meant to follow to decrypt their files.",
      "EFDC ransomware is most commonly distributed in programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed an unverified program, that may be how EFDC ransomware infected your computer.",
      "NOTE: To learn more about STOP ransomware and its variants, refer to the .STOP entry."
