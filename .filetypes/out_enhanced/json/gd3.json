      "GD3 files are obscure since the program is no longer developed and was not very popular back in the 2000s. However, you may still encounter a GD3 file if you had previously documented family information with the GreatFamily program. You may also acquire a GD3 file sent to you by another family member that designed a family tree with the software.",
