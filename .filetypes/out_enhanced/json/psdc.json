      "Adobe introduced the PSDC format in November 2019 when it released Photoshop for iPad and Photoshop CC 2020 for Windows and macOS. The purpose of the format is to allow users to work on the same PSD document on their computer or iPad and have their modifications synced so the document is always up-to-date.",
      "The PSDC file format is the same as the PSD format, which includes support for image layers, adjustment layers, layer masks, annotations, and other Photoshop-specific elements. However, the PSDC format also supports caching of edits made to a document when a user works on it offline. Then, the changes are synced when the user connects to the Internet again.",
      "To create a PSDC file in Adobe Photoshop, select File â†’ Save or Save As... . If you are prompted to save the document on your computer, click the Save to cloud documents button, name the PSDC file, then click Save . If you are prompted to save the document to your Cloud documents storage space, name the PSDC file, then click Save ."
