      "Graphics professionals in the video game, film, television, and architecture industries use 3ds Max to create 3D models and animations. When you save a project with 3ds Max, the application creates a 3ds Max scene (MAX file) to store the contents. After saving the project, you can close it and re-open it to continue editing it.",
      "NOTE: 3ds Max was previously known as 3D Studio MAX, which saved scenes in the MAX and .3DS formats. You can still export scenes as 3DS files with 3ds Max 2022 (and earlier versions)."
