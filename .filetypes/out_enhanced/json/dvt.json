      "During trials, lawyers may want to show a videotaped deposition and its transcript to juries simultaneously. IPRO TrialDirector (formerly inData TrialDirector) allows users to do this by linking a video and its transcript together as a DVT file. The DVT file contains the video and its transcript, synchronized so they can be played together.",
      "InData DepoView is a free DVT file viewer that allows users to search for a specific portion of testimony in a DVT file, create a clip of that portion, and export the clip to PowerPoint or in other video formats. Users who don't have access to TrialDirector can use DepoView to open, edit, and export clips or text from DVT files.",
      "NOTE: Some DVT files may contain other kinds of transcripted audio or video, such as a 911 call, CCTV video, or wiretap audio."
