      "Digital video cameras that record BRAW videos, such as the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K and URSA Mini Pro 12K, embed the metadata in the BRAW format. However, when you edit the BRAW file with a video editor, such as DaVinci Resolve, the editor creates a SIDECAR file to store the edits you apply to the video. Examples of metadata a SIDECAR file stores include BRAW settings, focal length, white balance, tint, and color space.",
      "NOTE: Blackmagic Design introduced the SIDECAR file type in 2018 when it released the BRAW format."
