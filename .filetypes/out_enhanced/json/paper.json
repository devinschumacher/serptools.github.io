      "Dropbox launched the Paper service in 2017 as an online workspace for teams to create, review, revise, organize, and present ideas. Paper stores each document you create in separate PAPER files that organize all of the elements you add to the document.",
      "While you can share links to your documents for others to access, you cannot download PAPER files from the online workspace since Paper only uses them internally. However, you can share a link to download a .URL shortcut to the PAPER file, which the recipient can double-click to open in the Paper workspace. The file will appear with an underscore preceding the document name followed by the .paper.url extension (e.g., _document.paper.url )."
