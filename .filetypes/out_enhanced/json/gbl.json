      "Gerber format files, like GBL, act similar to .PDF files. They're an exported version of the PCB layout and are meant to be viewed and referenced but not edited.",
      "The name of the GBL file is derived from the name of your PCB. Therefore, if your PCB is called \"MyProject,\" the file will be called MyProject.gbl .",
      "NOTE: The Gerber format was originally developed by Gerber Systems but is now maintained by Ucamco."
