      "Rolling Sky Remake is a Windows, Mac, and Android game in which players roll a ball across a 3D path, dodging obstacles along the way. It is based on the original Rolling Sky game.",
      "Players can create their own Rolling Sky Remake levels (using the game's level editor) or import other players' levels. These levels are saved as RSR files. While players can typically edit RSR files created by other players, some are password-locked and can be edited only if the player knows the associated password."
