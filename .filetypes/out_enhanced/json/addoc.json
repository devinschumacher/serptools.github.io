      "MOTU AudioDesk is a digital audio workstation ( DAW ) that allows audio producers to edit, mix, record, play back, and export audio. When producers create a new project in AudioDesk, the program saves the project as an ADDOC file.",
      "ADDOC files do not contain any audio. Instead, they contain references to the audio files used in an AudioDesk project, as well as data used to organize and apply edits made to those files. Typically, AudioDesk imports and stores audio files referenced in ADDOC files in the program's Audio Files folder.",
      "NOTE: While you can download MOTU AudioDesk for free from MOTU's website, you must possess a MOTU audio interface to install AudioDesk. So, you cannot open an ADDOC file in AudioDesk unless you own a MOTU audio interface."
