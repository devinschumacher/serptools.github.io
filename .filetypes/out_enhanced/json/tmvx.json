      "TMVX files are saved in a proprietary format and are similar to Microsoft Word templates ( .DOT or .DOTX files). They may be converted to other formats in TextMaker, including .PDF , .DOC , .DOCX , DOT, DOTX, TMD, TMDX, TMV, .ODT , .PSW , and .RTF .",
      "You can create a TMVX file by selecting File → Save or Save as , and then choosing the TMVX format. You can open a TMVX file by selecting File → Open and navigating to the TMVX file. You can also choose File → New and select the TMVX template from which you want to create your new document. TMVX files are saved by default in the \"Templates [version]\" folder of the \"SoftMaker\" folder in your \"Documents\" folder path.",
      "NOTE: TMVX files replaced .TMV files as the primary file type used to store templates."
