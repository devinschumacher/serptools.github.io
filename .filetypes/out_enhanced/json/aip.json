      "Artists and graphic designers use Adobe Illustrator to create logos, signs, digital art, and drawings. While Illustrator includes a wealth of design and drawing features, users can add additional features by installing Illustrator plug-ins. These plug-ins, which are developed by Illustrator users and third-party companies, are saved as AIP files.",
      "For example, the companies Astute Graphics, Fontself, and Mai Tools all offer Illustrator plug-ins, distributed as AIP files. These plug-ins provide artists with additional effects, allow artists to convert sketched lettering into fonts, and help artists automatically crop images. Other Illustrator plug-ins provide other advanced features.",
      "Some Illustrator plug-ins are free to download and install, while others must be purchased. Many plug-ins are available from Adobe's official website, on the Third-party plug-ins for Illustrator page."
