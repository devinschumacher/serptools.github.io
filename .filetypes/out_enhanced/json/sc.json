      "Supercell is a Finnish mobile game development company that is most well known for producing the game Clash of Clans. All of Supercells' games include textures packaged within SC files.",
      "These files' names always end with _tex.sc . For example, a file that contains a game's user interface elements may be named ui_tex.sc .",
      "SC files whose names do not include _tex are metadata files that a game uses to load textures correctly."
