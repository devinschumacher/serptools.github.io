      "GSL Biotech SnapGene is a molecular biology program that documents, designs, and simulates DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. Genetic scientists often use the software to conduct and document facets of their research.",
      "In May 2021, GSL Biotech introduced the RNA format when it released SnapGene 5.3. When you save a sequence with SnapGene, the software creates a file to store the contents. Snap Gene saves each type of sequence in a different file format:",
      "To create an RNA file with SnapGene, follow these steps:",
      "After creating the RNA file, you can save it by selecting File â†’ Save or Save As... . Then, after saving the file, you can close it and re-open it to modify the sequence further."
