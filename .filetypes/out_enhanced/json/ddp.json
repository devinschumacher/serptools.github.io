      "DreamPlan Home Design is a multi-platform 3D modeling software that home designers use to create 3D representations of homes, including the homes' interiors and exteriors. Designers can lay out a home's floor plan, customize the home's interior, customize the home's exterior, model renovation projects, and even add landscaping features in DreamPlan Home Design.",
      "When a designer saves their in-progress home design project, DreamPlan Home Design saves the project in a DDP file. Designers can also use a DDP file to export the 3D model they've created as an .OBJ or .STL file."
