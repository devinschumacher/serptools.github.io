      "FL Studio Mobile is the mobile version of Image-Line FL Studio . It is available primarily for Android, ChromeOS, and iOS. It can also be used on Windows and Mac PCs, either by itself or in conjunction with the desktop version of FL Studio.",
      "Just like FL Studio, FL Studio Mobile allows you to install plug-ins that add additional instruments and audio effects. These plug-ins load instruments and effects from FLMPST files, which are also referred to as plug-in presets.",
      "Most plug-ins are packaged with some default FLMPST files. You can download and install additional FLMPST files from the Internet."
