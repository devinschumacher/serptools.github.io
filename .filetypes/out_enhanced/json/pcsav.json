      "PCSAV files created by Mass Effect 2 can be imported into Mass Effect 3. However, you must make sure that the ME2 PCSAV files are stored in a save directory with the following location and name format:",
      "C:\\​Users\\​[user]\\​Documents\\​BioWare\\​Mass Effect 2\\​Save\\​[player_profile]\\​",
      "The [player_profile] should be in the format Name_##_Class_200212 , where Name is the name of your character (e.g., John), ## is the character level (e.g., 30), and Class is the character class (e.g., Vanguard, Infiltrator, etc.). The 200212 code represents the date and must be a valid date string. Now, when you open ME3, choose the Import ME2 Character option and import your player profile.",
