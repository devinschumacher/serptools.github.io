      "C++ is one of the most common programming languages, with developers using it to create various applications, such as database management software, image editors, games, and web browsers. Bjarne Stroustrup developed C++ to improve upon the C programming language and released it in 1985. It grew quickly in adoption and is now maintained by the Standard C++ Foundation.",
      "The .cxx file extension is one of several extensions you may encounter appended to files storing C++ source code. Other extensions for C++ files include .CPP , .CC , and .C (stores C and C++) source code files."
