      "The 7z format was initially released in 1999 and utilized by 7-Zip, a free, open-source application used to archive and compress data. It was eventually placed in the public domain in December 2008 and is still maintained.",
      "7z compression uses the LZMA method by default. The 7z format also supports the PPMD, BCJ, BCJ2, BZip2, and Deflate compression methods. Additionally, the file type supports Unicode file names, multi-part archives, archive header compression, and file sizes up to 16,000,000,000 GB."
