      "Apple introduced the QTFF format in 1991 to support different media types and accommodate multimedia transfer between devices, operating systems, and applications. While it is primarily associated with the QuickTime media player and Mac platform, it has grown into one of the most common video file types, along with .MP4 , .WMV , and .AVI .",
      "The format supports multiple media tracks and is not limited to video and audio data. Other media supported by QTFF includes text (subtitles), images, 3D models, virtual reality panoramas, and timecode data. Media tracks may be encoded by various codecs but typically utilize the MPEG-4 codec.",
      "NOTE: Multimedia files saved in the QTFF format may also use the .QT file extension.",
      "While the MP4 format is based on the QTFF format utilized by MOV files, there are noteworthy differences between MP4 and MOV files. One difference is that MOV files are typically higher in quality and file size than MP4 files. Another difference is that MOV files are not as widely supported as MP4 files.",
      "Because of these differences, there are situations where each file type is better suited for your needs. For example, if you want to save a movie at a higher quality and storage space is not an issue, you should save the movie as a MOV file (as long as the video player supports MOV files). However, if you want to save a home movie, share it with others, and can accept a bit of degradation in quality, you should save it as an MP4 file."
