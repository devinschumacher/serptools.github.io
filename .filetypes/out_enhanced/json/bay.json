      "Camera Raw image files are not directly usable unless a program supports the file type and camera model used to capture the image. You can touch up BAY files with select image editors, such as PaintShop Pro and ACDSee, and then export them to standard raster formats such as .JPG or .BMP .",
      "NOTE: Casio Camera RAW files also use the .RAW extension."
