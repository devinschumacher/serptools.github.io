      "Fritzing is a printed circuit board (PCB) design application that Arduino and other PCB enthusiasts use to create PCB layouts. Fritzing projects contain a digital representation of a real-world electronic circuit. Typically, Fritzing projects are saved as FZ files, but those who want to share their project with others can export the project as a compressed FZZ file.",
      "FZZ files contain every file a user needs to open and edit a project in Fritzing, including any custom parts ( .FZPZ files) the project includes. This makes it easy for Fritzing users to share projects with each other, even if they do not have the same bins and parts installed in their separate instances of Fritzing."
