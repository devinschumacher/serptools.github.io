      "The Locked virus is malware that is commonly referred to as ransomware, where the purpose of the virus is to take your files hostage and force you to pay the perpetrator (by way of bitcoin) to unlock your files. The virus is typically introduced through an email attachment, P2P network, or fake software update. Once the virus affects your computer it begins scrambling your files, renaming them, and encrypting them. The virus then generates a .TXT ransom note informing you of the takeover and what you need to do to recover your files."
