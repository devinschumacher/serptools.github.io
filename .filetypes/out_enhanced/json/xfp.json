      "Lucom FormsForWeb is a form creation tool that allows users to create and distribute fillable forms. These forms, which are saved as FFWP files, may be embedded within web applications or distributed for offline use (with Lucom FormsForWeb Filler).",
      "Users creating a form in FormsForWeb can save an editable version of the form as an XFP file. This Zip-compressed file contains the form and its assets, such as scripts, images, and templates. Packaging a form and its assets as an XFP file makes it easier to share that form with other FormsForWeb users. For example, a user who wants to share a prototype form with a co-worker may package and share the form as an XFP file."
