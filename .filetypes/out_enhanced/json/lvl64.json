      "Gamers can use ROMs and emulators to play console video games on their PCs and other devices. SM64 ROM Manager is a tool that modders can use to customize a ROM of Super Mario 64, a platforming game for the Nintendo 64. After customizing their ROM, gamers can load it in an emulator to play their modded version of Super Mario 64.",
      "One of the ways SM64 ROM Manager allows modders to customize Super Mario 64 is by creating custom game levels, using the program's Level Manager. In the Level Manager, modders load one or more 3D objects and use those objects to overwrite one of the game's default levels. They then specify level settings, such as the level's start point and music.",
      "If a modder wants to export the custom level they've created, they can do so by selecting Export in the level manager. This allows the modder to save their custom level as an LVL64 file."
