      "HTML was introduced in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee and other CERN engineers as a way for web browsers to interpret and display webpages. Since its release, it has become a standard in web development and has gone through multiple revisions, which include HTML 2 (1995), HTML 3 (January 1997), HTML 4 (December 1997), and HTML 5 (2014).",
      "The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) develops and advances HTML. The group was founded in 2004 and consists of major browser developers, including Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Mozilla.",
      "The markup language features HTML elements that make up the structure of webpages. Typically, each element includes an opening tag enclosed in angle brackets ( <tag> ) and a closing tag enclosed in angle brackets but with a forward slash preceding the tag ( </tag> ).",
      "Some examples of basic elements include:",
      "Over time, other web technologies, such as Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) and JavaScript , have been introduced to enhance webpages. You will most likely find CSS or JavaScript code or references to .CSS or .JS files in modern HTML webpages.",
      "Web developers often create and edit HTML files, then upload them to web servers that web browsers parse when a user visits webpages. If you are an average Internet user, you most likely will not see the HTML source code since your web browser parses it in the background.",
      "However, you can still view the HTML of a webpage with a web browser by following these steps specific to the browser:",
      "NOTE: Most pages within static websites have an .html extension, while pages within dynamic websites may have a .php or .asp extension."
