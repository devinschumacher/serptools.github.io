      "MacGourmet Deluxe allows cooks to import recipes from culinary websites or create new recipes of their own. Cooks can then organize, annotate, search through, print, or export their recipes. The program's proprietary MGOURMET format is one format in which cooks can export recipes.",
      "Unlike other MacGourmet Deluxe export formats, the MGOURMET format retains a user's notes, wine notes, and embedded images. An MGOURMET file may contain one recipe or many recipes, depending on how many recipes the cook selected before selecting File â†’ Export ."
