      "Shark007 Icaros uses a set of Windows shell extensions to provide thumbnails for many types of videos. Icaros can provide thumbnails for videos saved in most formats recognized by FFmpeg .",
      "Optionally, a user can choose to cache the thumbnails Icaros creates in an ICDB file. To enable caching, users must select Cache from Icaros's menu. They can then choose to manually or automatically create ICDB files. If Windows File Explorer deletes a thumbnail Icaros created, Icaros can retrieve the thumbnail from its cache, speeding up the process of regenerating that thumbnail.",
      "Typically, Icaros ICDB files are saved in the following directory:",
