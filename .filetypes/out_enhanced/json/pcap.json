      "PCAP is an API used to capture network data packets . Wireshark saves records of the data it captures via the PCAP API as PCAP files.",
      "In addition to a record of a packet's contents, each PCAP file also contains metadata about the captured packet. For example, PCAP files specify a packet's source and destination, the protocol used to send the packet, and the time at which the packet was sent.",
      "NOTE: While Wireshark is the most common program used to create PCAP files, several other packet capture programs also save captures in the PCAP format."
