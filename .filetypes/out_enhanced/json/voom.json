      "In March 2022, some PC users began reporting their computers had been infected by VOOM ransomware, which is a variant of STOP ransomware. This malware encrypts a user's files (most notably, pictures and documents) and appends them with the .voom extension. It then produces a plain text ransom note named _readme.txt in every folder that contains an infected file.",
      "The ransom note contains an explanation of what has happened to the user's files, as well as how the user can pay a ransom to decrypt their files. The ransom message asks for a ransom of $980, unless the user contacts the ransomer in the first 72 hours after infection, in which case the ransom is halved to $490.",
      "VOOM ransomware is most commonly distributed in programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed an unverified program, that may be how VOOM ransomware infected your computer."
