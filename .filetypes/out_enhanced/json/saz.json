      "Fiddler is a multiplatform web debugging tool that allows you to capture, analyze, and modify your web traffic. IT professionals use Fiddler to troubleshoot web connection issues.",
      "After logging a record of your web traffic in Fiddler, you can save that record as an SAZ file. SAZ files are Zip-compressed archives that may be password-protected or encrypted. They contain a human-readable record of your web traffic (saved in an .HTM file), metadata (saved in an .XML file), and a raw folder. The raw folder contains .TXT and XML files representing saved web sessions."
