      "In the game you start out on a simple raft and are tasked with surviving dehydration, hunger, fatigue, and sharks. You can gather debris floating in the ocean to create equipment to survive and expand your raft by building foundations, pillars and stairs. You can also plant trees for coconuts and wood and boil sea water in order to survive. When you save your game, all of the progress is saved in the RGD file. You can access saved games in the main menu of the game.",
      "Raft is early in production and is available for download as a prototype. New versions with updates to the game are continually being released. Therefore, your RGD saved game file may not be compatible with a newer version of the game. For example, saved games before version 1.04 are not compatible with version 1.04 of Raft.",
      "The game is developed by three students from Uppsala University - Campus Gotland in Visby, Sweden that are known as Raft Developer. Semih Parlayan is the programmer while Ellen Mellåker and André Bengtsson are the artists for the game."
