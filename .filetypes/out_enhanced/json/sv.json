      "You can open SV files in any text editor. However, you may want to use an editor designed specifically for handling SystemVerilog source code, such as Sigasi Studio or ModelSim.",
      "SystemVerilog is used in the semiconductor and electronic design industry. It is a combination of hardware description language (HDL) features and hardware verification language (HVL) features with C and C++ features. It was adopted as IEEE Standard 1800-2005 in 2005, IEEE Standard 1800-2009 in 2009, and IEEE 1800-2017 in 2017.",
