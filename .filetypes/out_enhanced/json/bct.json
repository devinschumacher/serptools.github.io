      "BCT files are saved alongside .BC files, which together comprise Adobe Bridge's cache. The cache can be centralized or distributed, meaning that the files are either stored in one location or distributed to every folder being browsed. Users can set the caching option in the software.",
      "NOTE: You can safely delete both BCT and BC files. However, Adobe Bridge regenerates them the next time you browse images in the application."
