      "In 2016, some PC users reported that their computers had been infected by a new form of ransomware called 7ev3n. 7ev3n encrypts, renames, and moves a targeted variety of a user's files. It then shows the user a ransom note. The note includes instructions the user can follow to pay a ransom of 13 Bitcoin and receive a private key that will allow them to decrypt their files.",
      "Later in the year, an additional strain of 7ev3n, called 7ev3n-HONE$T, began infecting computers. 7ev3n-HONE$T asked users to pay only one Bitcoin to decrypt their files, possibly because by this point, a helpful GitHub user named hasherezade had developed a free tool that could be used to decrypt R5A files."
