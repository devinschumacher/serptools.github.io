      "Creo Parametric is a CAD program that engineers use to design manufactured parts and assemblies. Engineers can also use Creo to analyze the designs they've created (e.g. test tolerances) and export the designs in formats used by Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines.",
      "Parts created in Creo Parametric are saved as PRT files. While Creo is the primary application that uses PRT files, some other CAD applications can open them.",
      "NOTE: Creo Parametric was formerly known as Pro/Engineer and Wildfire."
