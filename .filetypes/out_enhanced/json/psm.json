      "Lars Hamre and the Amiga Freelancers released Protracker Studio in 1990 for the Commodore Amiga, but they no longer develop the software. It was a popular tracker-based music sequencer in the demoscene that allowed musicians and programmers to create sample-based chiptune and module music. The PSM format stores songs composed with the software, supporting complex compositions with relatively small file sizes.",
      "NOTE: There are different PSM (Protracker Studio Module) formats, which can cause compatibility issues between various tracker programs. The Epic MegaGames PSM variation was used in games developed by Epic MegaGames (now Epic Games) in the 1990s and differs from standard Protracker modules by including additional metadata and effects, making it incompatible with some standard tracker software."
