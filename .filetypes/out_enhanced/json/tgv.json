      "Some games that use TGV files include NBA Live 96, Need for Speed, Privateer 2, and StarLacer. These games were all released in the 1990s and are no longer developed.",
      "You will most likely only encounter a TGV file if you have installed a game that utilizes the TGV format on your computer. You may also encounter a TGV file if you dump the game files from a disc or cartridge that utilizes the TGV format."
