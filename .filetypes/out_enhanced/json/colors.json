      "Artists can use Corel Painter's Color Set Libraries panel to group many colors together into a color set. For example, an artist who is creating multiple pieces of artwork that will be used by the same company may want to group that company's brand colors into a color set. Then, the artist can quickly choose the correct, company-approved color(s) from the color set while painting, drawing, or adding text and shape elements.",
      "If an artist knows they will use a color set they've created again in the future, they can save that color set as a COLORS file. Then, the artist can import the color set and quickly select colors from it when working on future projects.",
