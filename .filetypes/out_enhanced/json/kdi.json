      "Like many other skin formats, KDI files are saved with a layout settings ( .KDS ) file in a .ZIP archive, which is the skin for the player. The KDS file maps the graphics in the KDI graphic to the user interface elements.",
      "NOTE: KDI files can be opened by any image viewer. For convenience, you can rename the \".kdi\" extension to \".jpg\" or \".png\" while editing the graphics, and then change it back to \".kdi\" when packaging the skin."
