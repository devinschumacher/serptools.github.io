      "Java Virtual Machine (JVM) enables a computer to run a Java program. JRE is a software package that includes a JVM implementation and a Java Class Library implementation. JDK is a superset of JRE and also comes with Java programming tools. POLICY files are used by JRE and JDK to determine the permissions of Java programs installed on the computer. The file grants access to actions such as read/write permissions to files in a certain directory.",
      "You can create and edit POLICY files with a text editor or the policytool utility, which can be opened by typing policytool at the command line in the JDK. If a POLICY file is updated the Java programs must be restarted in order for the updates to be applied. If there any syntax errors in the POLICY file the Java programs will fail. Using the policytool utility will help prevent syntax errors.",
