      "OAP files may be used to store web apps that are run in a web browser or mobile apps for tablets and phones. You can create an OAP file with Service Studio by selecting Environment â†’ Application Management... then clicking Download on the page that loads. After creating the package, you can share it with another OutSystems user and they can open it in Service Studio.",
      "You can also extract the contents of an OAP file with a Zip decompression utility since it is compressed with Zip compression. To do this, change the .oap file extension to .zip and open it with a Zip utility, such as Microsoft File Explorer, Corel WinZip or Apple Archive Utility.",
      "NOTE: Service Studio is included with Integration Studio in the Development Environment application. The tool is a \"low-code\" IDE that includes WYSIWYG drag-and-drop components that make app development more accessible for beginners."
