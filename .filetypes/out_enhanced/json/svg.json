      "The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) developed the SVG format and released its initial version in 2001. Since then, W3C has released several updates to the SVG format, including SVG 1.1, SVG Tiny 1.2, and SVG 2.0.",
      "Unlike .JPG , .PNG , and other raster image files, SVG images are not comprised of pixels . Instead, SVG images are defined using XML-like text that describes how the image should appear. For example, when opened in a text editor, an SVG file might look like this:",
      "<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 93 107\"> <path d='M74,74a42,42 0,1,0-57,0l28,29a42,41 0,0,0 0-57' fill='#00a3dc' fill-rule='evenodd'/> </svg>",
      "Because the image an SVG file describes is defined using text-based paths, rather than pixels, it can be scaled up or down without losing any quality. This is why digital illustrators save logos and icons, which need to be shown or printed at a variety of sizes, as SVG files.",
      "Web developers also often publish SVG files on webpages, since the graphics they contain will look good at any resolution, and search engines can read the text the files contain (which may help with search engine page ranking). These developers can also modify SVG images using CSS and scripting languages (such as JavaScript ) if needed.",
      "Various vector graphics editors allow you to save graphics as SVG files. Some popular vector graphics editors that can create SVG files include:",
      "NOTE: If you need to reduce an SVG's file size (for example, to make it easier to share online), you can export it as an .SVGZ file. This compresses the image with gzip compression, reducing its file size by 50 to 80 percent."
