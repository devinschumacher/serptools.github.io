      "PhysicsEditor allows video game developers to import sprites and create collision shapes associated with those sprites. Developers can then export the collision shapes they've created in a variety of formats, for use with different game development engines.",
      "After a user purchases PhysicsEditor, CodeandWeb supplies that user with a license key they can use to register their copy of the program. These license keys are provided via email and may sometimes be saved within PEKEY files. Users can also view their current CodeAndWeb licenses within the company's online license manager."
