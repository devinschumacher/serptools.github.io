      "The TI-84 Plus family of graphing calculators are tools that middle school, high school and college students use to plot functions, analyze numerical data, solve complex equations, and perform other mathematical operations. The TI-83 Premium CE graphing calculator, which is a TI-84 Plus family calculator that was released only in France, is notable for having a screen that displays colors, which helps users visualize data.",
      "TI-84 Plus calculators use a unique operating system (OS) and applications. To update a TI-83 Premium CE calculator's OS and applications, a user must download the most recent B83 update file from Texas Instruments' website and install that file on their calculator. B83 files are installed on calculators using TI Connect CE, a desktop app that allows users to manage and update their calculators from their PCs.",
      "NOTE: Before using a B83 file to update your calculator, you should use TI Connect CE to create a copy of any important files your calculator contains. Updating your calculator may overwrite your files."
