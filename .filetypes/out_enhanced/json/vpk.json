      "VPK files are saved as part of a VPK package. Each VPK package has a master VPK directory file named archive_dir.vpk (where \"archive\" is the name of the VPK package) and VPK archive files named archive_0.vpk , archive_1.vpk , etc.",
      "You can create VPK files using the vpk.exe command line tool located in the game directory. To ensure compatibility, you should use the vpk.exe tool located in the directory of the game you are creating the VPK file for. In Windows, the vpk.exe tool will most likely be located in the following directory: C:\\​Program Files (x86)\\​SteamApps\\​common\\​[game title]\\​bin",
      "NOTE: The VPK format is the successor to the .GCF format."
