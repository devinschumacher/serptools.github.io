      "In the 1980s, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (The Church) released the first version of the GEDCOM format, which is a universal format genealogists use to exchange data across genealogy programs. Over the next three decades, The Church and various genealogy-minded developers collaborated to improve upon the GEDCOM format. In 2021, FamilySearch, the family history arm of The Church, released version 7.0 of GEDCOM, which included the specification for building a GEDZip utility.",
      "When implemented in genealogy software, GEDZip's primary function is to allow users to bundle historical pictures and other files with their existing FamilySearch GEDCOM / GED genealogy data files. To do this, software that includes GEDZip zips the GEDCOM / GED file and media files together into a GDZ file. The GDZ file is a Zip archive that can be decompressed and, in the future, read by a variety of genealogy applications, allowing professional and amateur genealogists to import, review, and save their genealogical data and historical documents using one file."
