      "Cisco Packet Tracer is an application that provides a learning environment for students to learn networking, cybersecurity, and IoT skills. People commonly use the software for distance learning, work planning, and professional training.",
      "Before version 8.1 of Packet Tracer, the application saved instructions for users as Packet Tracer Activity (PKA) files. However, Cisco introduced the Packet Tracer Tutored Activity (PKSZ) file format when it released 8.1 to support activities with more dynamic elements, such as instructions and hints, not previously available with PKA activities."
