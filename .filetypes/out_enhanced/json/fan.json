      "MakeMusic Finale is a professional music composition program used by composers. As part of creating musical scores, composers can add text that uses different fonts. Each Finale font is accompanied by a FAN file, which contains annotations that define the height and width of each font character.",
      "Composers can also install third-party fonts and use them with Finale. When they do so, they must create a FAN file to accompany those fonts. Composers create new FAN files from Finale's Preferences → Edit menu, by selecting the Font Annotation... button.",
      "NOTE: By default, Finale stores FAN files in the ~/​MakeMusic/​Finale ##/​Font Annotation directory."
