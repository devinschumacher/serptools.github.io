      "Web developers use JavaScript to add dynamic and interactive elements to webpages. One of the ways developers can add JavaScript functions to a webpage is by importing them using a JS file.",
      "Developers usually import JS files in the <head> or <body> sections of a webpage's HTML, as shown below:",
      "<head> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"FileInfo.comExample.js\"></script> </head>",
      "JS files often contain standard or site-wide functions that a developer wants to include on each of a site's webpages. Storing the functions in a single, importable JS file makes them easier to maintain and troubleshoot."
