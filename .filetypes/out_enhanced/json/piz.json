      "If you receive a PIZ file you should verify the identity of the sender in order to ensure that the file does not contain malware . Once you verify that the file is safe, rename the \".piz\" extension to \".zip\" and open it with any Zip decompression utility. Some popular programs are WinZip, Win RAR, 7-Zip, and Stuffit Deluxe."
