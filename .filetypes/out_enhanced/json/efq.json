      "The Ensoniq SQ-1, SQ-2, and KS-32 synthesizers were popular keyboards in the 1990s that allowed musicians to create, edit, and play a wide range of synthesized sounds. The EFQ files the keyboards create help users store complex configurations without needing to manually recreate them every time. Although the Ensoniq SQ-1, SQ-2, and KS-32 synthesizers and the EFQ format are no longer widely used, users may still encounter EFQ files when working with vintage Ensoniq gear or in digital audio archives."
