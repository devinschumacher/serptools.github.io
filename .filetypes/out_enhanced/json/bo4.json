      "Minecraft Java Edition players can install the OpenTerrainGenerator plug-in and use it to create and load custom Minecraft worlds. Each OpenTerrainGenerator world is generated using one or more biome configuration ( .BC ) files. In turn, each biome configuration file references a set of BO4 files, which contain information about custom structures that appear in the biome.",
      "BO4 files are created in-game using the /otg export StructureName -bo4 command. The referenced structure is then exported as two or more BO4 files. The first BO4 file, named StructureName.bo4 , contains settings that apply to the entire structure and define placement, distribution, and blending with terrain. Each subsequent BO4 file contains information about an up-to-16x16 block section of the exported structure. When creating a custom world, modders place BO4 files in the world's WorldObjects directory.",
      "NOTE: You can convert .SCHEMATIC files to BO4 files using OTGEdit."
