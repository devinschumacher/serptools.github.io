      "Localization is the process of translating text and audio content for use across multiple languages. Software programs, including the macOS operating system , use a variety of localization schemes to show content to users in their preferred language.",
      "Part of macOS's system-level localization scheme depends on LOCALIZED files. These files are hidden, blank files that macOS references when showing a directory's name to users. If a directory contains a blank LOCALIZED file, macOS can translate that directory's name into any of its system languages.",
      "Because LOCALIZED files are hidden files that do not appear even after a user chooses to show hidden files (using the Cmd + Shift + . shortcut) on their Mac, most users will never encounter a LOCALIZED file. The most likely way a user would encounter a LOCALIZED file is by viewing the file within a different operating system installed on their Mac. For example, Parallels Desktop users who have chosen to show hidden files in Windows may see a LOCALIZED file on their Windows desktop."
