      "The DuckDuckGo web browser is a privacy-minded browser published by DuckDuckGo. While the browser is downloading a file, such as a video, image, or audio file, it appends the .duckload extension to that file's name. For example, as the file example.jpg is being downloaded, it becomes example.jpg.duckload . After the download finishes, the browser automatically removes the .duckload extension.",
      "If you encounter a .duckload file and are not currently in the process of downloading a file, it is likely you stopped a download or a download was interrupted. Thus, DuckDuckGo never removed the .duckload extension from the file's name."
