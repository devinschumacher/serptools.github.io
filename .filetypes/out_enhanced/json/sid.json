      "SID files are created with a .SIS file and a .SIM file, which provide metadata necessary to restore backup game data. SID files use the naming convention {game}_disk{X}_{Y}.sid , where \"game\" is the name of the backup game, \"X\" is the disk number, and \"Y\" is the backup file number on the disk.",
      "NOTE: Steam backups do not include saved games, custom multiplayer maps, or configuration files. You must backup and restore those files manually."
