      "MATLAB is an advanced application that provides various tools to analyze data, develop algorithms, create models, build apps, and more. In MATLAB, a figure is data visualized as a plot, such as a histogram or pie graph, output from mathematical data. Additionally, the figure function creates a figure (window), which allows you to insert plots and graphs.",
      "To create a FIG file:",
      "NOTE: You can also save a figure as a FIG file with the saveas(fig,filename) function."
