      "Boxlight MimioStudio is a suite of tools that allows teachers and students to create, show, and interact with electronic whiteboard presentations. MimioStudio includes a tool called Mimio Notebook, which teachers use to create drawings, charts, slides, and other items they can present on a whiteboard. These presentations are saved as Mimio Notebook files, which use the .ink file extension.",
      "INK files can contain any number of notebook pages, which can be shown and paged through on a whiteboard. Pages and objects on pages (such as drawings, text, and videos) can be moved within a notebook as teachers see fit. Teachers can also copy images and other select content from a notebook to other applications, such as Microsoft Office programs. If a teacher needs to share an INK file with a student or other teacher that does not have access to Mimio Notebook, they can export the INK file as an .HTML , .JPEG , .PNG , .GIF , .TIFF , or .PDF file.",
      "NOTE: INK files created in newer versions of MimioStudio may not open in older versions of MimioStudio, because some MimioStudio features are not compatible across versions."
