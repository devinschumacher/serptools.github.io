      "You can open a C10 file manually in WinAce to view the contents within the partial archive. However, the files in the C10 file may only be partial and may not be able to be extracted. To restore the original files from the split archive, you must have the other parts as well as the master ACE file.",
      "C10 files are actually the 12th part of the split archive, since there is a master ACE file and the numbering system starts with .C00 .",
