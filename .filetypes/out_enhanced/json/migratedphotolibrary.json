      "When Photos successfully migrates a iPhoto library, the \"photolibrary\" file extension is changed to\"migratedphotolibrary\" and Photos makes a hard link to all of the iPhoto media assets. Photos uses the same directory structure as iPhoto.",
      "NOTE: Photos performs a similar function with Aperture libraries but uses the .MIGRATEDAPLIBRARY file."
