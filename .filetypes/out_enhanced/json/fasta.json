      "David J. Lipman and William R. Pearson created the FASTA format and released it in 1985. Many DNA apps have adopted support for the format because of its simplicity, making it one of the most common formats for transferring sequences between applications.",
      "FASTA files often start with a header line that may contain comments or other information. The rest of the file contains sequence data. Each sequence starts with a > character followed by the name of the sequence. The rest of the line describes the sequence, and the remaining lines contain the sequence itself.",
      "NOTE: Files saved in the FASTA format may use various file extensions besides .fasta , such as .fas ( .FAS files) and .fa ( .FA files)."
