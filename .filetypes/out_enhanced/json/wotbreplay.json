      "In 2013, Wargaming.net released World of Tanks Blitz. This mobile-friendly version of World of Tanks, which was initially released on Android, iOS, and Windows mobile devices, allows players to engage in 7-on-7 virtual tank battles. Later, Wargaming.net released Windows, Mac, Steam, and Nintendo Switch versions of World of Tanks Blitz.",
      "After players finish a World of Tanks Blitz match, they can view and save a replay of that match. These replays are saved as WOTBREPLAY files. Players can also share WOTBREPLAY files with each other if they want to watch each others' replays. Some players upload their WOTBREPLAY files to replay-hosting websites like wotinspector.com, to make the files easier for other players to access."
