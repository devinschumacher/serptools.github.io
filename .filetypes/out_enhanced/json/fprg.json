      "Flowgorithm allows developers to create programs using a graphical, flowchart-based interface. To do this, developers add functions, declarations, inputs, outputs, and other program components, each of which appears as a colored shape. They then connect these colored shapes together to form a flowchart.",
      "Each Flowgorithm program is saved as an FPRG file. These files consist of XML-formatted text that define a program's overall function, as well as the function of its individual components. For example, if a program includes both a main function and several sub-functions, the FPRG file defines all those functions."
