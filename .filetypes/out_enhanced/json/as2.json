      "AS2 files are designed to allow ActivStudio users share and import resources into their .FLIPCHART presentations. The resources are helpful for making more engaging presentations.",
      "ActivStudio featured a collection of tools for presenting on an interactive whiteboard. The primary use of the software was to design and present flipcharts (stored in FLIPCHART files) that could include text, shapes, images, video, lines, and flash media. ActivStudio eventually became Promethean ActivInspire.",
      "NOTE: AS2 files are saved in a format that is no longer supported. The files were replaced by AS4A files."
