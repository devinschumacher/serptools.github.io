      "CNC Mastercam is a widely-used CAD/CAM package for engineers or machinists to design and produce mechanical components. When a user saves a 2D or 3D machine toolpath in the Toolpaths pane in Mastercam, the software creates an NC to store its information.",
      "Users typically save their NC file(s) to a portable storage device, such as a USB flash drive, then transfer it to a CNC machine tool. They then load the file in the tool to direct it as its cuts a path in a piece of material, such as wood, plastic, or metal."
