      "TimeZero Navigator and Professional are marine navigation programs that allow mariners to plot routes and mark points of interest on topographical charts. Mariners can save the data they enter in TimeZero Navigator and Professional as TZD files.",
      "TZD files do not contain the charts upon which they were created. Before opening a TZD file, you must install the corresponding chart in TimeZero Navigator or Professional, to ensure you can view the TZD file's data correctly.",
      "NOTE: In version 4 of TimeZero Navigator and Professional, the .TZX format replaced the TZD format. However, you can still open TZD files in those versions."
