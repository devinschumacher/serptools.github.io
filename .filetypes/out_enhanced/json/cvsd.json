      "CVSD encoding was developed in the 1970s. It is used primarily to encode audio signals sent via radio, telephone, and other voice communication methods. For example, some Motorola radios encode audio using CVSD, as do some digital telephones.",
      "The audio a CVSD file contains is compressed in a lossy manner. The audio's quality relates directly to its sampling frequency."
