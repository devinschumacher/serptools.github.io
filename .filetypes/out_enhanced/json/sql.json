      "You will most likely only encounter SQL files if you develop or manage web databases. The SQL language first appeared in the 1970s at IBM and was adopted by the ANSI and ISO standard groups in 1986 as the standard language for relational database management systems (RDBMS). Since its adoption, it has gone through multiple revisions to support a wider set of features and has spawned several database language variations, which include Mini SQL (mSQL) and MySQL.",
      "NOTE: SQL may be pronounced as \"S-Q-L\" or \"Sequel.\""
