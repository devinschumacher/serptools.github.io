      "Samsung Notes is a note-taking app installed on some Samsung smartphones, such as the Galaxy A7 and A10, and other devices. In 2020, Samsung Notes began saving users' notes as SDOCX files. The SDOCX format replaced the .SDOC format, which Samsung Notes previously used to save users' notes.",
      "Contrary to what you might expect, SDOCX files are not text files. Instead, they are Zip-compressed archives that contain an XML file and a Media folder. The XML file contains a note's text and other data, while the Media folder contains any images, videos, or other media saved within the note.",
      "During the transition from the SDOC to SDOCX format, some users experienced problems opening notes in the updated version of Samsung Notes. For example, users who had locked a note that was saved as an SDOC file could not open that note in the updated version of Samsung Notes, unless they unlocked the note from a device that had not yet updated to the new version of Samsung Notes.",
      "For most users, however, Samsung Notes automatically converted their SDOC files to SDOCX files as they opened old notes. Users could also manually convert SDOC files to SDOCX files using the Old format notes â†’ Convert option available in Samsung Notes' settings menu."
