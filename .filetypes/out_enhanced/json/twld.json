      "TModLoader is a free add-on that allows players to install mods for Terraria, a 2D sandbox exploration game. After installing mods, players can use tModLoader to create modified Terraria worlds.",
      "Unlike normal Terraria worlds', modified worlds' data is split across two files: a normal WLD file, which contains typical Terraria world data, and a TWLD file, which contains all the world modifications created by the player's installed mods. To load a modified world, you must possess both its WLD and TWLD file (and store them in the appropriate Terraria directory)."
