      "Sony developed the ATRAC3 format to reduce audio file size while maintaining acceptable sound quality, making it suitable for portable devices. Additionally, Sony commonly used ATRAC3 in the early 2000s for storing music on MiniDiscs, MP3 players, and other portable media devices.",
      "Users often managed and transferred AT3 files between a computer and portable Sony devices with SonicStage software (developed by Sony). Today, AT3 files are less common, and support for the ATRAC3 format has largely been discontinued in favor of more widely supported audio formats, such as .MP3 and .AAC .",
      "NOTE: Users may also encounter similar formats, such as .AA3 and .OMG files, which are related to ATRAC3 and sometimes include Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) to control playback."
