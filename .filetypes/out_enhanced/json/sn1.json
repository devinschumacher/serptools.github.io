      "Drive Snapshot allows Windows users to create backup copies of their drives . They can then use these backups to restore or recover their files if needed.",
      "If a drive's contents are small enough, Drive Snapshot saves them in a single SNA file. However, if the drive contains a large amount of data, Drive Snapshot creates continuation files that contain the rest of the drive's data. These files use the same base filename as their associated SNA file, but the .SN1 , .SN2 , and so on extensions. For example, a file named Backup.sn1 is the first continuation file for a backup named Backup.sna ."
