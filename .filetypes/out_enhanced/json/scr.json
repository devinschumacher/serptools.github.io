      "Screen savers were originally created to prevent CRT and plasma computer monitors from suffering screen burn , a condition that occurs when the screen shows the same image for too long. While most modern monitors do not suffer from screen burn, screen savers are still used for security purposes (to hide a user's screen and require a login before resuming work) and to show a user's style."
