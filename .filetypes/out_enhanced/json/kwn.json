      "Étranges Libellules was a French video game developer that released a handful of games, including Asterix & Obelix XXL, Asterix at the Olympic Games, and How to Train Your Dragon. To develop their games, Étranges Libellules used a game development engine called the K engine.",
      "Games developed using the K engine store each level's assets in a level-specific KWN archive. If an asset is used across multiple levels, a copy of that asset is stored in each level's KWN file."
