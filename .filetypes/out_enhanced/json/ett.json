      "ETT files are similar to ET files, storing rows and columns of data, charts, and graphs, but they are primarily used for duplicating spreadsheets with similar layouts and information. The Spreadsheets program comes bundled with several ETT templates and allows you to download many more directly through the application. ETT templates can also be converted to other spreadsheet files such as .XLT , .XLTX , .XLS and .XLSX files.",
      "The WPS Office suite is similar to the Microsoft Office suite but is available for free. WPS Office offers three programs:",
      "Spreadsheets enables you to insert a variety of charts, shapes, equations, symbols, and tables into your spreadsheet. The application also enables you to insert a variety of financial, logical, date and time, lookup and reference, math and trig, and text functions."
