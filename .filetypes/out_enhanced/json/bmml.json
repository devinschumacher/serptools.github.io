      "A mockup consists of various assets, buttons, containers, forms, icons, text, media, and symbols used for designing a user interface or website. Balsamiq Mockups originally stored mockups in .XML files then introduced BMML files in version 2 of the program. BMML files are simply XML files with the \".bmml\" extension. However, BMML files were then replaced by BMPR files with the release of Balsamiq Mockups 3.",
      "NOTE: You can still import BMML files into Balsamiq Mockups by selecting Project â†’ Import ."
