      "Several inexpensive Chinese portable \"MP4\" players do not actually store or play MP4 videos. Instead, they play MTV videos. MTV videos are low resolution (a maximum of 128x128 pixels) and small in size (one minute of video is roughly 24 MB of data). Thus, media players can store and play many MTV videos without using much storage space or processing power.",
      "NOTE: While the MTV format is similar to the AMV format, which is also used by Chinese portable media players, the formats are different enough that not every AMV-compatible device or media player can play MTV files."
