      "DIF stands for data interchange format and is a standardized spreadsheet export format that is widely supported. The purpose of DIF files is to allow users to export data from a spreadsheet in a format that can be imported by a variety of programs.",
      "One limitation of the format is that it does not support multiple spreadsheets. This means that the DIF file can only store one spreadsheet. Therefore, if you need to export multiple spreadsheets in the DIF format you will need to create multiple DIF files."
