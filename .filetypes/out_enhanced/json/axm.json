      "Autodesk FormIt is a 3D modeling application that architects use to prototype building and site designs. To do so, they draw, place, and manipulate 3D shapes that represent a building or building component. Architects may also import 2D images into their models, for use as street maps, textures, or backgrounds, and add 2D lines that represent measurements.",
      "FormIt models, which are referred to in FormIt as sketches, are saved as AXM files. In addition to being able to open and edit AXM files in FormIt, architects can import the files into Autodesk Revit, a building information modeling application that architects, engineers, and contractors use to create a cross-discipline construction model."
