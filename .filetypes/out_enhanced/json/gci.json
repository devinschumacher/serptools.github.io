      "When GameCube players save an in-progress game, their progress is typically saved in a GCI or .SAV file. The American versions of GameCube games save players' progress in GCI files, while their European equivalents save games in SAV files. These files are stored on players' GameCube memory cards.",
      "Outside of loading saved games on their GameCubes, most GameCube players will not encounter a GCI file. However, those who use the Dolphin emulator to play GameCube games on their PCs can download, create, and open GCI files to resume in-progress games (including their own and other players') on their PCs."
