      "While MX4 files may contain MIDI audio data, they do not store associated audio files such as .WAV files. Therefore, to transfer a Mixcraft 4 project between computers, you have to copy the associated audio files as well.",
      "NOTE: Mixcraft 5 uses the .MX5 extension to store audio projects. Mixcraft 5 can still open Mixcraft 4 projects."
