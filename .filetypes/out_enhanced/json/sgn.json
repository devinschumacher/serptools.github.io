      "The SGN format is used by Signet, a technology that allows sellers to provide digital content directly to consumers, removing the need for an intermediate marketplace. If you receive an SGN file that contains a 3D model you can open it with SGN Viewer. However, SGN Viewer is no longer developed or available for download."
