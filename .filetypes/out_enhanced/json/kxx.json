      "Keyman Developer allows you to develop custom products. Each product comes with an encrypted keyboard, which is stored in the KXX file. The file is created when you create an installer for the custom Keyman Engine product. KXX files are locked to the custom product, making them incompatible with Keyman Desktop or any other custom product."
