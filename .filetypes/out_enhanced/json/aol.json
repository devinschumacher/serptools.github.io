      "America Online (AOL) is a company that specializes in online services, such as web browsing, email, and instant messaging. It was especially prominent in the 1990s and 2000s but declined due to the rise of other competitors. Verizon Communications acquired AOL in 2015.",
      "In the 1990s and 2000s, AOL provided desktop software that assisted users in performing various capabilities online. For example, its Shopping Assistant helped users browse for items and complete secure transactions.",
      "The application's utilities referenced the AOL files that came with the software. If you have access to an old version of AOL desktop software, you can find the AOL files in the software's installation directory."
