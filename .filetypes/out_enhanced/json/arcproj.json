      "ARRI Group is a German camera manufacturer that produces professional cameras and lenses. In addition, the manufacturer develops the ARRIRAW Converter (ARC) to provide a free application for photographers to view and edit ARRIRAW images (often .ARI files) they capture with their ARRI cameras.",
      "After opening an ARRIRAW image with ARC, you can modify it by adjusting its properties, such as saturation, gamma, exposure, and white balance. Then, you can save any adjustments you have made to the image(s) by selecting File â†’Save Project or Save Project as... . After saving the project as an ARCPROJ file, you can close it and then re-open it later to edit the images further."
