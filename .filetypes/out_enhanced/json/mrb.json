      "MRB files can be created with Microsoft's Multiple Resolution Bitmap Compiler (MRBC) in older Microsoft Windows SDKs . They may also be created in other Microsoft C/C++ software.",
      "MRB image files were often used when compiling help documentation using Microsoft's older help compilers ( HC30.EXE , HC31.EXE , HCP.EXE , and HCW.EXE ).",
      "NOTE: Because MRB files can contain multiple raw bitmaps, they can become very large in size compared to other compressed images."
