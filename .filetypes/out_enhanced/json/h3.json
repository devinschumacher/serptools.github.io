      "You will most likely only encounter an H3 file if you purchase and download a Wii U game from the Nintendo eShop. You may also encounter an H3 file if you dump a game from a disc using a disc extraction tool.",
      "If you dump a game to your computer for emulation purposes, the H3 file will be present in the game data folder with an APP file and other various Wii U game files, such as .TMD , TIK, and CERT files."
