      "Shaders are programs that produce lighting, shadows, and other special effects in 3D video games and other applications. Since the release of the PS4, PlayStation video games have used shaders written in the PlayStation Shader Language.",
      "For the most part, PSSL shaders follow the same conventions as shaders used for PC games. The PSSL language includes support for vertex, pixel, geometry, and compute shaders, as well as static and dynamic control flow."
