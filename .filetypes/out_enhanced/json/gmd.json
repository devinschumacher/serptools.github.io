      "Geometry Dash is a music-based platforming game in which players must click or tap in time with music to avoid obstacles. The game is available for iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS.",
      "Geometry Dash includes a custom level creation system that allows players to create their own levels, share them online, and play levels designed by other players. However, there is no official way to export levels as local files. So, Geometry Dash enthusiast HJfod created the GDShare utility, which allows players to save their custom levels as GMD files.",
      "The original GDShare utility functioned as an independent program that allowed users to export levels from and import levels into Geometry Dash. HJfod has since created an updated version of the utility, called GDShare-mod, which integrates directly with Geometry Dash. HJfod recommends that players use GDShare-mod, and not GDShare, to create and manage GMD files."
