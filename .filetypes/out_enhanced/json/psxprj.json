      "Photoscape X is a free image editor available for Windows and macOS. It allows users to import images and apply adjustments, effects, and transformations to them. For example, a user could use Photoscape X to crop, recolor, and add a text mask to an image.",
      "If a user wants to continue editing an image in Photoscape X in the future, they can save their current editing project as a PSXPRJ file. This retains a record of the modifications the user has made to the image, so they can remove them, adjust them, or compare their edited image to the original.",
