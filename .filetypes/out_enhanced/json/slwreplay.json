      "Salwyrr is a custom launcher players use to add features to the standard version of Minecraft Java Edition. One of the features Salwyrr includes is the ability to press the R key to record gameplay. Pressing the R key again stops the recording and saves it as an SLWREPLAY file.",
      "Each SLWREPLAY file's filename includes the date and time at which it was created. Players can play and edit the recordings SLWREPLAY files contain with Salwyrr's Replay Studio. They can also use Replay Studio to export recordings as .MP4 files.",
      "NOTE: Only some versions of Salwyrr include the ability to create and play replays."
