      "Crystal is a general object-oriented programming language that is based on Ruby . Unlike Ruby, however, Crystal is a compiled language. This means the language's source code files must be compiled before the code they contain can be executed.",
      "Developers typically save Crystal source code in plain text files that use the .cr file extension. Saving Crystal source code files with the .cr extension allows source code editors that recognize the Crystal programming language to highlight the language's syntax correctly."
