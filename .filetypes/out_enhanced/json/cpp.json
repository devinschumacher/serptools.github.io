      "C++ is one of the most popular programming languages, making CPP files very common among developers. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup and was first released in 1985 to improve upon the C programming language.",
      "It was initially standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1998 and has since undergone many improvements. It is maintained by ISO/IEC JTC1 / SC22 / WG21, with the non-profit Standard C++ Foundation providing support for the C++ software developer community.",
      "If you are a programmer, you most likely have worked with CPP files since C++ is used to develop many applications, such as games, web browsers, and database software. Some notable applications written entirely or partially in C++ include Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop, MYSQL, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Autodesk Maya.",
      "NOTE: C++ source code may also be saved as .C , .CC , and .CXX files, or as .HPP , .H , .HH , or .HXX header files."
