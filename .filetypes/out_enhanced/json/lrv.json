      "LRV files are used during the editing process to reduce the amount of computing power required to edit a video compared to using the HD file. After a video is edited the LRV file can be replaced with the HD file before rendering the final video.",
      "These files are also used for previewing with GoPro mobile applications, for playback via Wi-Fi , or as the streaming buffer when a smartphone is used as a control device.",
      "LRV video is recorded in 240p at 29.97 frames per second regardless of the camera's settings."
