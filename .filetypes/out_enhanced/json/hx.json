      "Haxe is an open-source , general-purpose programming language used to create video games, web applications, mobile applications, and cross-platform desktop applications. Notably, Haxe is used in the HaxeFlixel game engine, which is an open-source game engine used to develop 2D games.",
      "Haxe source code is saved in HX files. These files contain classes and functions used to run Haxe applications. When a developer compiles a Haxe application, the compiler transforms the application's HX files into a functional program.",
      "Complex Haxe programs may require multiple HX files to run. These files are organized in directories and sub-directories, which are often referred to in other HX files. In these cases, HX files may be referred to as modules, since they contain only part of a program's code."
