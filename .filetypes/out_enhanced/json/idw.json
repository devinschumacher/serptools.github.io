      "Engineers and product designers use Autodesk Inventor to design 3D prototypes of mechanical products. These prototypes are referred to as assemblies. After a user has finished an assembly, they can create a drawing that shows multiple views of that assembly, as well as its component parts. Other engineers and manufacturers use these drawings, saved as IDW files, to review a product's specifications.",
      "Some of the views an IDW file can contain include:",
      "NOTE: IDW files can be exported as .DWG files, for use with Autodesk AutoCAD and Autodesk Fusion 360."
