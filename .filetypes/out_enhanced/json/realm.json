      "Realm is a database management system that developers can use to allow their apps to create and access databases. These databases contain a variety of app-related information, organized as types and objects. For example, an app that tracks a user's online purchases may contain information about the products the user purchased, when the user purchased them, how much the user paid, and so on. Each category (e.g. Product Name) is saved as a database type, while each entry in each category (e.g. Pampers Diapers 204 Pack) is saved as a database object.",
      "The databases Realm creates are saved as REALM files. REALM files are primarily binary files, which are not meant to be opened outside of MongoDB Realm Studio. Apps that use Realm save their REALM databases in a variety of locations, depending on the app's platform. For example, on macOS and iOS, many Realm-enabled apps save REALM files to a sub-directory within their Documents directory. On Android devices, you can use the command adb pull /data/data/<packagename>/files/ to retrieve an app's REALM database.",
      "Developers may want to convert an existing database into a Realm database, so they can use that database with their Realm-enabled application. To do so, developers can save their existing database as a .CSV file and then use MongoDB Realm Studio to convert the CSV file to a REALM file. To convert a CSV file to a REALM file, open Realm Studio and select File → Create Realm from → CSV ."
