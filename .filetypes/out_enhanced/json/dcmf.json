      "DiskCatalogMaker allows Mac users to scan their hard drive and/or external storage media and catalog the files stored there. Users can then view, search through, and print these catalogs, to find where certain files are stored.",
      "Most commonly, DiskCatalogMaker users save their catalogs as DCMF files. These are database files that can be opened only in DiskCatalogMaker. Users can also save catalogs as .DCMD files, which contain thumbnail images for certain files.",
      "NOTE: Some versions of Roxio Toast include a special version of DiskCatalogMaker, called DiscCatalogMaker RE (Roxio Edition)."
