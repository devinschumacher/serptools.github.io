      "In 1996, the International Telegraph Union (ITU) and Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) published the first edition of the H.262 video codec . This codec was used to compress HDTV and other HD videos for use in broadcasts and on physical media, such as DVDs and Blu-ray discs. On rare occasions, H.262 videos were saved with the .h262 extension.",
      "In the years since H.262's release, it has been succeeded by improved video compression standards, including H.263, H.264, and H.264. These standards are used to produce .H263 , .H264 , and .H265 video files. ITU and MPEG last updated the H.262 standard in March 2013."
