      "StarMade's primary playing mode features single player gameplay where you can explore the universe finding materials to upgrade your ship and fend off attacks from enemies. The SMENT file can be opened by StarMade but since the file uses the Zip format, you can also extract its contents with a utility such as 7-Zip or WinZip."
