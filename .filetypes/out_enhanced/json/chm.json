      "As help documentation has improved and progressed toward website and browser-based formats, the CHM format has largely been retired. Most programs no longer use CHM-based help documentation, and most programs that previously opened CHM files are either unmaintained or no longer open CHM files.",
      "NOTE: While CHM files typically contain help documentation, some contain eBooks."
