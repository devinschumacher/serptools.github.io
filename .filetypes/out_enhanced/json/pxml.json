      "A PXML file is simply an XML file renamed with the \".pxml\" file extension that contains metadata about a Pandora application (game, word processor, etc.) in XML (Extensible Markup Language) format. Since the PXML file is similar to an XML file, it may also be saved as a PXML.xml file with some Pandora applications. The PXML file is created when a Pandora program is bundled into a PND file and typically contains a description of the Pandora software, the version, a link to the icon filename, the license the code is distributed under, preview pictures, and the developer of the program.",
      "NOTE: You can extract a PXML file from a PND file with the PNDTools or PNDManager utilities and view the PXML file with a text or XML editor."
