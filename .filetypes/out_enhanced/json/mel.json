      "Professional animators use Autodesk Maya to create 3D animated scenes for use in video games, films, and television shows. If an animator who is also a programmer wants to create a macro they can use to quickly complete a repetitive or complex Maya task, they can do so using Maya's Script Editor.",
      "After writing their script in Maya's Embedded Language, the animator can save their script as a MEL file. Then, the animator can execute their script via the Script Editor. This will automatically perform the action(s) the MEL file describes.",
      "Animators can also use MEL scripts to customize Maya's user interface. MEL scripts may include Python code, as Maya also supports the Python programming language.",
      "NOTE: Maya was originally developed by Alias Wavefront. Autodesk acquired Alias Wavefront in 2006."
