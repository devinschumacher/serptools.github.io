      "In Grand Theft Auto V, players can drive a variety of vehicles, including cars, motorcycles, bikes, boats, and planes. The 3D models used to show these vehicles in-game are saved as YFT files.",
      "Each vehicle uses two YFT files: vehiclename.yft and vehiclename_hi.yft . Vehiclename.yft contains data used to show the vehicle in various levels of detail, depending on how far away the game camera is from the vehicle. Vehiclename_hi.yft contains only the highest-detail 3D model of the vehicle, used when the game camera is close to the vehicle (and thus the vehicle's details should all appear).",
      "All YFT files are stored in an .RPF game data archive named vehicles.rpf . Grand Theft Auto V modders can use OpenIV, a popular Grand Theft Auto V modding utility, to extract YFT files from vehicles.rpf .",
      "NOTE: Players sometimes distribute custom YFT files online, used to modify GTA V vehicles."
