      "Graphic designers use color palettes to group specific colors together, making it easy to use the correct colors when designing an image. For example, a graphic designer might create a color palette for a particular brand, to ensure they use the correct colors while designing that brand's marketing materials.",
      "GIMP and some other image editing programs allow users to create, save, and import color palettes saved as GPL files. These files are plain text files that contain RGB values for each color included in the palette. GPL files are recognizable because they always start with the header GIMP Palette ."
