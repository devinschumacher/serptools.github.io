      "The ET file is the native spreadsheet format associated with Spreadsheets. However, it can be converted to the more popular .XLS or .XLSX files supported by Microsoft Excel and a number of other spreadsheet programs.",
      "The WPS Office suite is similar to the Microsoft Office suite but is available for free. WPS Office offers three main tools:",
      "Spreadsheets allows you to insert a variety of charts, shapes, equations, symbols, and tables into your spreadsheet. You can choose to begin from scratch when creating a spreadsheet or you can start from one of the many invoice, tracker, budget, calendar, business, and finance .ETT spreadsheet templates. The application also enables you to insert a variety of financial, logical, date and time, lookup and reference, math and trig, and text functions."
