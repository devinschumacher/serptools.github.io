      "In the 1990s, Microsoft set out to produce a competitor to Apple's TrueType font format. In collaboration with Adobe, Microsoft produced the OpenType font, or OTF, format. The OpenType format is similar to the TrueType format, except that it includes additional data structures that determine how fonts appear and behave.",
      "In the early 2000s, the OpenType format became an open font standard. Thus, most computer systems can now recognize and install OTF fonts.",
      "To use an OTF file as a font, you must first install it on your system. In Windows, you install fonts by placing them in the C:/​Windows/​Fonts directory. In macOS, you install fonts by opening them in Apple Font Book and selecting the Install Font button."
