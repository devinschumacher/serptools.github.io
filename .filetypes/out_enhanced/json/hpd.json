      "HotDocs PDF documents can be populated using HotDocs Filler, an application included with HotDocs. If you double-click an HPD file, HotDocs Filler opens by default. You can also use a prepared answer .ANX file to fill an HPD form.",
      "NOTE: The HPD format is based on Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF). HotDocs also supports an Envoy-based format ( .HFD files). Envoy was an early competitor to the PDF format promoted by the WordPerfect Corporation. HotDocs chose to adopt both Envoy and PDF formats and therefore developed two different file types."
