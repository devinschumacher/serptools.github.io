      "HShop is an online Nintendo 3DS content repository that allows players to download 3DS games, DLC, apps, extras, and themes. While gamers can download and manually install content from hShop, many instead download content using 3hs, an associated 3DS app. 3hs can be installed only on 3DSes that have been hacked to use custom firmware.",
      "Optionally, players can change 3hs's UI theme using HSTX files. Each HSTX file contains images that serve as various background and icon images, and color settings that determine various UI elements' colors. Players can install any number of HSTX files in 3hs's 3hs/â€‹themes directory. Then, they can select those files from the app's theme selection menu.",
      "To create an HSTX file, 3hs users use the theme creator available at https://hshop.erista.me/3hs/themegen . After they've finished naming, uploading images to, and specifying colors for their theme, they click the Create theme button to download an HSTX file that contains their theme's settings."
