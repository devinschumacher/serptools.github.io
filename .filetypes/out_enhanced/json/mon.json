      "Developer Jim Leonard, also known as MobyGamer and Trixter, created MONOTONE for use with vintage PCs and sound devices. Primarily, the program is meant to be run in MS-DOS. It allows users to create multi-track songs by specifying notes and effects in columns that represent each of a song's tracks. Users can then save the song they've created as a MON file.",
      "Because MONOTONE is available for only vintage PCs and operating systems, MON files are uncommon. However, developers interested in the vintage computing scene may encounter MON files."
