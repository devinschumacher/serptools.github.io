      "Swift is a programming language that developers use to create apps for Apple devices, such as MacBooks and iPhones. Primarily, developers create Swift apps using Apple Xcode, an IDE for macOS, or Swift Playgrounds, an iPad and Mac app for novice Swift developers.",
      "As developers create Swift apps, they save the source code they write in SWIFT files. In Xcode development projects, SWIFT files are saved within the project's directory structure and referenced within the project's XCODEPROJ file. In Swift Playgrounds development projects, SWIFT files are saved within the project's SWIFTPM file.",
      "NOTE: Apple introduced the Swift language with iOS 8 and macOS Yosemite."
