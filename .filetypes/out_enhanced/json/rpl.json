      "In Toribash, players control the joints of stick-figure-like characters to create custom fighting moves. Players can play against the game's AI or other players. They can also practice their moves in free play modes.",
      "If a player wants to save a replay of their match or free play session, they can do so by pressing F at the end of the session. Toribash then saves a record of the session as an RPL file.",
      "Each RPL file contains plain text data that Toribash uses to replay the match or free play session it describes. Players can share RPL files with each other so they can watch and edit each others' replays. (To edit a replay, press E while the replay is playing.)",
      "Toribash typically saves RPL files in its ~/​Toribash/​replay directory. For example, the Windows Steam version of Toribash saves RPL files to the following directory:",
