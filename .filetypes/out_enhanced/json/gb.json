      "Gaming enthusiasts utilize emulation software to play games on their computers without the gaming console that initially played them. For example, gamers who want to relive the games they played on Game Boy in the 1980s - 90s use emulation software, such as VisualBoyAdvance, KiGB, and BGB, to emulate Game Boy game ROMs.",
      "To get game data stored in game cartridges into a playable format, gamers dump game data from the cartridges with special hardware and software, then save the data in the GB format on their computer. They may then upload the files to share with others who can then download the GB files to play them on their computer with an emulator."
