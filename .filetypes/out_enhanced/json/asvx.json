      "MakeMusic Finale is a music notation program used to compose, edit, and play back musical scores. In Finale 2014 and later versions, these scores are saved as MUSX files.",
      "Composers can configure Finale to automatically back up any MUSX files they have open at a regular interval. Finale saves these automatically-generated backups in the following directory:",
      "~/​Documents/​Finale Files/​Backups",
      "Each backup uses the same filename as the MUSX file from which it was created, except the backup's filename ends with asv.musx . Finale users and documentation often refer to these backup files as ASVX files, even though the files use the .musx extension.",
      "Finale users can adjust how often the program creates and updates ASVX backups. To do so:",
      "NOTE: Finale 2012 and earlier versions create .ASV files instead of ASVX files."
