      "GeneWeb is used to record, organize, and publish genealogical information. It utilizes a web server that can be accessed with a web browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, and returns an HTML webpage with the specific genealogical information requested.",
      "Users create GW files with GeneWeb to store genealogical data, which may include family, relationship, and personal notes. GW files may also store events if they were created with version 7 of GeneWeb or later.",
      "You can create a GW file with GeneWeb using the \"gwsetup\" utility included with the software. In the user interface, click \"GeneWeb source file\" under the \"Save\" section. You can also create a GW file with the gwc command in the GeneWeb command-line interface.",
      "NOTE: GeneWeb was developed by Daniel de Rauglaudre, a researcher at the Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique (INRIA)."
