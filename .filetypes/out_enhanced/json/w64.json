      "The W64 format was designed to surpass the 4 GB limitation of Microsoft's 32-bit RIFF/WAV specification. W64 files are 64-bit and allow for file sizes greater than 4 GB. This enables W64 files to store more audio than .WAV files.",
      "NOTE: The Wave64 format was developed by Sonic Foundry but now is maintained by Sony. The official name of the format is Sony Picture Digital Wave 64."
