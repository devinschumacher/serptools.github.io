      "While Symthink is discontinued, the app previously allowed users to list and organize information related to a central question, claim, or idea. Symthink saves these lists as THK files.",
      "Typically, each THK file contains a central idea or hypothesis and supporting ideas, reasoning, and evidence. THK files may also store links to sources from which users gathered ideas, reasoning, or evidence.",
      "NOTE: Users can link THK files together by importing one file's content into another file."
