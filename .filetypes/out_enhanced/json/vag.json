      "While the VAG format is most commonly associated with PS1 games, it is also used in some notable PS2 and PSP games. For example, the Sly Cooper series of video games uses VAG audio files, as do Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future and F1 2009.",
      "Most gamers will never encounter VAG files. However, some utilities allow gamers to extract VAG files from PlayStation video games; others allow them to play and convert the files."
