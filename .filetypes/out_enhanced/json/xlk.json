      "Microsoft Excel is a widely-used spreadsheet application that is part of the Microsoft Office suite. It provides a large number of tools for organizing, manipulating, and visualizing data.",
      "When working on spreadsheets with a lot of data it is a good idea to create backups of your data. While Excel provides the AutoRecover feature in case the application crashes, it is important to have backups of your work in case you are no longer able to open the original file or you want to archive the data.",
      "Excel automatically creates an XLK backup of your file when you save a file in the application with the \"Always create backup\" option selected. To turn this option on or off in Excel:",
      "Excel creates the XLK file in the same location as the location of the file you are saving. However, it does not create the XLK file until you save the original file and it is always one save behind the original file.",
      "Also, Excel names it as Backup of , and then the name of the original file. For example, an XLK backup for a file named Example Spreadsheet.xlsx is named Backup of Example Spreadsheet.xlk ."
