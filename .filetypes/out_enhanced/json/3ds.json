      "Autodesk initially developed the 3DS format in 1990 as the native format for Autodesk 3D Studio. As the software grew in popularity, so did the format.",
      "However, Autodesk eventually replaced 3D Studio with 3ds Max, and newer software versions saved 3D models in the .MAX format, by default. Even though Autodesk replaced the 3DS format with the MAX format, many 3D applications still support the format.",
      "The 3DS format consists of data blocks called \"chunks\" containing an ID and length description. Chunks store the shapes, lighting, and viewing information that together represent the three-dimensional scene."
