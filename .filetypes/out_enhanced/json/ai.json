      "Graphic designers, illustrators, and digital artists widely use AI files when creating precise and editable artwork. AI files support layers, shapes, text, gradients, transparency, and advanced features like artboards and custom brushes. Designers often choose the AI format when they need a working file they can revisit and update, as it preserves the original vector data and design elements created in Illustrator.",
      "While AI files are best opened and edited in Adobe Illustrator, many other programs, including Adobe Acrobat, Photoshop, and some third-party design tools, support viewing or converting them. For broader compatibility, users often export AI files to more widely supported formats like .PDF , .SVG , .EPS , or .PNG for use in web design, printing, or sharing with clients. When sending artwork for professional use, itâ€™s helpful to include both the original AI file and a flattened export in one of these standard formats."
