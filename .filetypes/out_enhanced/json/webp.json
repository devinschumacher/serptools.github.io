      "Google developed the WebP format with technology it acquired from On2 Technologies in 2009 to improve upon the JPEG, PNG, and GIF formats. In 2010, Google released WebP as an open format, extending it with new features, such as animation, transparency, and additional metadata support, in subsequent years.",
      "WebP features a container format based on the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF), an open format developed by Microsoft and IBM. Additionally, lossy compression utilized in WebP is loosely based on the royalty-free VP8 video format. In contrast, a Google software engineer named Jyrki Alakuijala designed WebP's lossless compression algorithm."
