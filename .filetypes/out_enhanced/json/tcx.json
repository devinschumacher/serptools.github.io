      "In 2007, alongside the release of Garmin Training Center, Garmin introduced the Training Center XML (TCX) file format. TCX files are similar to .GPX files, in that both are used to map runners' and cyclists' routes. However, TCX files also store data recorded during a user's workout. For example, TCX files log users' activity type, lap times, maximum speed, calories burned, and exercise intensity.",
      "Garmin and Fitbit device users can export TCX files from their devices and use the files in other programs, such as Garmin Connect, Strava, and the desktop versions of Google Earth. For example, Fitbit users can export their data from Fitbit.com by:",
      "If you encounter a TCX file on your computer, it was likely exported from a workout-tracking device or program.",
      "NOTE: The TCX format is available in both TCX v1 and TCX v2 schemas."
