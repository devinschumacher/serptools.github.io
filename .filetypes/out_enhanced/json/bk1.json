      "BAK files are automatically created when users save drawing files. Therefore, when a program crashes, Autodesk applications try to rename the BAK file to BK1 to prevent a corrupted drawing file from replacing the original backup.",
      "NOTE: If the BK1 extension is already in use, Autodesk programs use \".bk2\" through \".bk9,\" as well as \".bka\" through \".bkz\" and \".baa\" through \".bzz\" until a unique extension is found."
