      "The PES format is one of the most popular file formats in the embroidery community and is supported by a large number of embroidery applications. PES files may be created by various embroidery applications, which include PE-Design software included with Brother sewing machines, but may also be used with Babylock and Bernina home embroidery machines.",
      "Users may upload PES designs online and share them in web forums, on websites, and as email attachments. Other users can then download PES designs and open them with a program that supports viewing or editing the PES format.",
      "To transfer the design to a sewing machine, users can save their design to a portable USB storage device. Then, they can insert the storage device into the sewing machine to transfer the design to embroider it."
