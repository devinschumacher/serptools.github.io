      "Apple copy-protects the M4B files they provide using FairPlay DRM . This means M4B files you download via iTunes or Apple Books can be played only on authorized computers and Apple devices, using iTunes or Apple Books. Therefore, if you are having trouble playing an M4B file, it might be because you are not playing it in iTunes or Apple Books, or because your device is not authorized to play it."
