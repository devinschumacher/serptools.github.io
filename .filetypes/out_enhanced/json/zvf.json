      "Hexagon publishes applications that allow process plant, power plant, and marine structure designers to create and review 3D models of complex structures. Hexagon's software suite includes SmartPlant Publisher and Smart Interop Publisher, programs used to create and publish models, and SmartPlant Review, a program used to review models.",
      "When publishing a set of models from SmartPlant Publisher or Smart Interop Publisher, designers can choose to package those models within a single ZVF file. Like Hexagon SVF files, ZVF files contain multiple models saved in the VUE format, as well as accompanying attribute and metadata files. However, unlike SVF files, ZVF files are Zip-compressed, to make them easier to share with others and store on a network or cloud server.",
      "NOTE: Hexagon recommends saving and opening models as VUE files when possible, to maximize application performance and model fidelity."
