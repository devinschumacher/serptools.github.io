      "A JSP tag is similar to an HTML tag. For example, a custom tag <loadData> could be used for loading data into a JSP Web page. The custom tag library would have a class handler for this type of tag and the TLD file would describe the tag.",
      "Tag libraries and tag descriptors are included with Java-based Web applications. Often the TLD file is packaged as part of a .JAR file that is located in the /​WEB-INF/​lib/​ directory."
