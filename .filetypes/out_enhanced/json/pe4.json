      "Ulead PhotoImpact is a discontinued image editing program used primarily to edit photographs. Version 4 of PhotoImpact was released in 1997.",
      "PhotoImpact version 4 (and the fourth version of other Ulead programs, such as PhotoExplorer and iPhotoPlus) cached thumbnails of images that users had opened or viewed in a file named imageiio.pe4 . It also cached image metadata in a file named imaginfo.pe4 . Doing so allowed PhotoImpact to quickly load and display thumbnail images to users (in areas such as the app's sidebar file explorer)."
