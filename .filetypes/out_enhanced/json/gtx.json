      "Textures are game assets used to skin 3D models, so they appear with the correct colors and textures. For example, a texture might be used to apply the correct color and texture to a character's skin or clothing.",
      "Many Wii U games use textures saved as GTX files. For example, Mario Kart 8 uses GTX textures. GTX files are often paired with accompanying .GSH shader files.",
      "NOTE: GTX stands for GX2 TeXture."
