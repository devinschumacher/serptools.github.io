      "Prior to 2018, Firefox and SeaMonkey users could install an .XPI add-on called Mozilla Archive Format. This add-on allowed users to save a webpage or set of webpages as a MAFF archive. Users could then open the archive in Firefox or SeaMonkey to view the webpages the archive contained, even while offline.",
      "In addition to storing webpages, MAFF files store the webpages' metadata . The files also contain all downloadable media content, such as images, audio, or video files, that the saved webpages contained.",
      "After installing the Mozilla Archive Format (MAF) add-on, users could save webpages as MAFF files by selecting File → Save Tabs As... or File → Save All Tabs As... from Firefox's menu bar.",
      "Mozilla Firefox 57 and later versions do not support MAFF files. However, you can still install the MAF add-on and use it to open MAFF files in Mozilla Firefox 56, which is still available for download online ."
