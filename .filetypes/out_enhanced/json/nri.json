      "Nero Burning ROM software specializes in ripping, copying, burning, and protecting data. When you configure a CD, DVD, etc., to burn data to, the software creates an NRI file to store the list of files you added to be burned.",
      "NOTE: If you have moved or deleted any files included in the NRI file, they will not be burned to the CD, DVD, etc."
