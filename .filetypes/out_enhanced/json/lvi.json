      "Lazesoft Recovery Suite allows Windows users to perform several data backup and recovery tasks, including repairing boot errors, removing viruses, recovering Windows passwords, and backing up their data. When a Lazesoft Recovery Suite user backs up their system's data, the program saves the data in an LVI file. LVI files are stored on external media or drives, such as a CD, flash drive , or external hard drive, which users can insert or connect to their PC when they need to restore their system."
