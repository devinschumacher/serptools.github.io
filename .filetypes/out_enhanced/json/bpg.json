      "Developer Fabrice Bellard created the BPG file format in 2014, as a potential replacement for the JPEG format. Bellard based the BPG format's compression method on the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) compression standard, which is more efficient than JPEG compression.",
      "The BPG format supports:",
      "Despite its advantages over the JPEG format, the BPG format is not widely used. However, Bellard's work on the BPG format inspired the creation of the .AVIF format, which also uses a video compression standard to create high-quality compressed images."
