      "SB3 files are saved in the Scratch 3.0 file format, SB2 files are saved in the Scratch 2.0 file format, and .SB files are saved in the original Scratch file format. Each SB3 file is a .ZIP archive that stores a development project's contents, including sprites , scripts , costumes, and sound files.",
      "Typically, developers create SB3 files by saving projects to their computer from MIT's online Scratch Editor, which can be accessed from https://scratch.mit.edu/ . To save a Scratch Editor project as an SB3 file:",
      "Developers can also create SB3 files in MIT's offline Scratch editors, which are available for Windows, macOS, Android, and ChromeOS devices.",
      "NOTE: In SB3 , the S stands for \"Scratch,\" the B for \"Binary,\" and the 3 for the version of Scratch (3.0)."
