      "iMazing is a Windows and Mac application that iPhone users can use to back up all or some of the data stored on their iPhones. In the past, if a user wanted to export all the data their iPhone contains as one file, they could export their data from iMazing as an IMAZING file.",
      "However, current versions of iMazing do not allow users to export their data as IMAZING files. Instead, users can export their photos, videos, messages, settings, and app-specific data in separate files. App-specific data is saved in .IMAZINGAPP files."
