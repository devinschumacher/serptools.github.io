      "Picocrypt is a multiplatform encryption tool used to secure files. To encrypt a file or folder, users drag and drop it into Picocrypt, enter the password they want to use to encrypt it, and select Encrypt . Picocrypt then encrypts the file or folder using XChaCha20 encryption and saves the result in a PCV file.",
      "If a user drags a folder into Picocrypt, all that folder's files will be compressed, encrypted, and saved in a .zip.pcv file. When the user decrypts this file, Picocrypt will produce a .ZIP archive, which much be decompressed to view the original files."
