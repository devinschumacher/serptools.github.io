      "ISO files are saved in an uncompressed format based on the ISO-9660 file system standard for optical disc media (hence the .iso file extension and \"Disc Image\" file type). The files are archives that store all the data from a disk image, including the filesystem information, such as directory structures, file attributes, and boot code. Additionally, ISO files are typically large since they store a lot of data.",
      "Before streaming media, many computer users extracted, copied, and burned ISO files from and to optical discs, such as CDs and DVDs, to copy, share, or back up their contents. ISO files store a sector-by-sector copy of every bit of data exactly from the disc, which is different than copying all files from a disc because the disc header information is lost in the copy process.",
      "Users may also download ISO files from the Internet when installing new software or operating systems since an ISO file contains all the necessary information for installation. For example, you can download an ISO file from Microsoft.com to create a bootable installation media, such as a USB flash drive, or to create a virtual machine running Windows 11."
