      "In the Bloons Tower Defense series, players attempt to stop balloons from escaping a maze, by placing towers that pop the balloons. These towers attack the balloons using various weapons.",
      "Each tower's name and properties, including its cost, default weapon(s), targeting rules, and placement rules, are saved in a TOWER file. These files are plain-text JSON files. While most players will never encounter or need to edit a TOWER file, players who want to mod a Bloons Tower Defense tower can do so by opening and editing the tower's TOWER file, then including the file in a Bloons Tower Defense mod package.",
      "NOTE: TOWER files are stored in a game's TowerDefinitions directory."
