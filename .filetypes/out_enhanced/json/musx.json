      "Composers use MakeMusic Finale to create, edit, and listen to musical scores. For example, a composer might use Finale to compose a new version of \"Auld Lang Syne,\" add lyrics to the score, and play the score back via their computer's speakers to check for errors.",
      "Finale 2014 and later versions save the scores that composers create as MUSX files. In addition to the score a composer has created, each MUSX file contains MIDI data that Finale uses when playing back the score.",
      "NOTE: Finale 2012 and earlier versions save scores as .MUS files."
