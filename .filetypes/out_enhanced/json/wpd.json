      "WordPerfect is used in home, academic, and business environments for letters, invitations, resumes, newsletters, and other documents. The application can save documents in a variety of formats, including the proprietary Corel WPD format, which is the application's primary file type.",
      "You can choose the format you want to save the document in by selecting File â†’ Save As... , then select the File type dropdown menu. Some formats besides WPD include Word .DOCX or .DOC , OfficeWriter .WP , and WordStar .WSD files.",
      "NOTE: Corel discontinued the DOS and Macintosh versions of WordPerfect in 1997. However, the company still develops the Windows version and includes it as the primary application in the WordPerfect Office suite."
