      "Microsoft Access is a relational database management system ( RDBMS ) available for Windows. It allows users to create, manage, and report on databases, as well as connect those databases to other applications.",
      "In Microsoft Access 2003 and earlier versions, users could create database workgroups, which specified one or more users who should be able to access or update a database via user-level credentials. These workgroups (and included users' login credentials) were saved as MDW files.",
      "In Access 2007, Microsoft removed the ability to grant database permissions at the user level. Thus, Access 2007 databases cannot be linked to MDW files.",
      "NOTE: You may see MDW files referred to as WIFs; WIF stands for w orkgroup i nformation f ile."
