      "While BUNDLE files appear as singular files in Finder, they are actually macOS packages (which contain a collection of files). Many of macOS's BUNDLE files are stored in sub-directories of the following directory:",
      "Macintosh HD/​System/​Library",
      "These files contain various data used by macOS and default macOS applications.",
      "In contrast, app-specific BUNDLE files are often stored in an app's installation or support directory."
