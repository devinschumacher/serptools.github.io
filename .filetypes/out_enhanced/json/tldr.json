      "After navigating to https://www.tldraw.com/ in your web browser, you can use tldraw to create simple or complex whiteboard drawings. Drawings can consist of lines, shapes, text, and/or inserted images and other media. You can also customize your drawings using multiple styles.",
      "If you want to save a drawing locally, for use in the future, you can use tldraw's File â†’ Save feature. This saves the drawing as a TLDR file. The file contains JSON text that tldraw reads and uses to display the saved drawing, including any media inserted into the drawing.",
      "NOTE: Tldraw's source code and a prototype desktop version of the app are available on GitHub."
