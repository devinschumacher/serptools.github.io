      "TupiTube is a kid-oriented application that allows children to create, play, and share simple 2D animations. The program saves users' animation projects as TUP files.",
      "After a user finishes creating their animation in TupiTube, they can export it as a video ( .MP4 or .MOV file) or sequence of images ( .PNG , .JPG , or .SVG files). They can also upload their animation to the online community at TupiTube.com, to share it with other TupiTube users.",
      "TUP files are renamed ZIP archives, so you can change their extension to .zip and decompress them to view their constituent files. However, you will likely never need to view a TUP file's constituent files. Instead, open the file with TupiTube to view the project it contains."
