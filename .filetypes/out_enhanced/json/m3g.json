      "Nokia (in collaboration with others) created the original M3G format as part of developing the Mobile 3D Graphics API for the Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition (J2ME). Many 3D mobile games use this standard to incorporate and show 3D graphics to players.",
      "Other companies, such as Electronic Arts, have since expanded on and modified the original M3G format. 3D models included in these companies' games may still use the .m3g extension, even if they are saved in a variant of the original M3G format.",
      "NOTE: M3G files may also contain embedded textures."
