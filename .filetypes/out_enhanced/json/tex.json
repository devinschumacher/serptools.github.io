      "LaTeX documents, such as TEX files, contain plain text with tags and other LaTeX syntax that define the document's structure, such as a letter, book, or article. This formatting differs from the inline text formatting utilized in word processor documents like .DOCX and .ODT files.",
      "Common word processors, such as Microsoft Word, OpenOffice Writer, and Corel WordPerfect, are often referred to as WYSIWYG programs. These word processors enable you to see how your text appears as you create it.",
      "LaTeX applications, such as TeXworks and Texmaker, may be referred to as \"WYSIWYM,\" which stands for \"what you see is what you mean.\" Instead of seeing the text formatted in the document, a LaTeX processing system handles the visual formatting based on the tags and other LaTeX syntax defining the document's structure. Therefore, a LaTeX document may look different depending on the LaTeX application used to display the file.",
      "NOTE: TEX files may also be saved with the .ltx ( .LTX file) or .latex ( .LATEX file) extension."
