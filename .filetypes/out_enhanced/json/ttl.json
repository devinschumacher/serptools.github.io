      "An AGT game consists of typing commands to navigate through a story, similar to a choose-your-own-adventure book.",
      "AGT games can be packaged with a wide variety of files that contain game data, including DA1, .INS , and .VOC files. Because of the large number of files that accompany the AGT game, the files can be converted into a single .AGX file with the AGT2AGX utility that comes with AGiliTy. This conversion reduces clutter, decreases load time, and reduces game size over 100K."
