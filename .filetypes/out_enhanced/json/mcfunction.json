      "Minecraft is a popular block-based construction and exploration game. Two versions of the game exist: the original Java Edition and the later Bedrock Edition.",
      "In both versions, players can use MCFUNCTION files to add new game functions, which they can execute in the chat window by typing /function and selecting the appropriate MCFUNCTION file. Functions contain a list of one or more commands, all of which are executed when the player executes the function. For example, a function can be used to execute multiple fill commands, quickly filling a specific region with sets of pre-specified blocks.",
      "Players write and edit MCFUNCTION files in text editors, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code , Microsoft Notepad or Apple TextEdit . They then import them into Minecraft, using slightly different methods in each edition."
