      "LIKO-12 is one of several fantasy gaming consoles that developers and gamers can use to create and play retro-style video games. (Others include TIC-80 and PICO-8.) The app is open-source, and game developers can use it to build games that they then save as LK12 files.",
      "After a developer finishes developing a LIKO-12 game, they typically share the game's LK12 file online, so other LIKO-12 users can play it. For example, the \"Share LIKO-12 Games !\" thread linked from LIKO-12's homepage contains links to several LK12 files."
