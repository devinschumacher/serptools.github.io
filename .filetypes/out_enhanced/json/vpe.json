      "Vanishing points are used for specifying the 3D geometry of a 2D image, such as placing planes on a picture where you're looking through a tunnel or at a road off into the horizon. After importing into After Effects, you can add lighting or other effects that make the original 2D image look three-dimensional.",
      "To import a VPE file into After Effects, choose File → Import → Vanishing Point (.vpe)... . To create a VPE file in Photoshop Extended, choose Filter → Vanishing Point... , draw the shape of your planes, and then select \"Export for After Effects\" from the Vanishing Point window."
