      "ProPresenter 6 creates PRO6 files when you save a new presentation. The presentation may be a song with multiple slides for verses and choruses, a slideshow with multiple slides of images and videos, or another type of custom presentation meant to be displayed in ProPresenter.",
      "All ProPresenter 6 documents are stored in the Library, where users can search for their different presentations and then display them. You can go to the location where the PRO6 file is stored by right-clicking the document in ProPresenter and selecting \"Open File Location\" in Windows or \"Reveal in Finder\" in macOS.",
      "PRO6 files do not include the multimedia files (e.g., .MP3 , .MOV , or .WMV files) included in the presentation. If you wish to include multimedia files with the document, export your document as a .PRO6X file by choosing File → Export Document → As Bundle... . You can also right-click an existing document and select Export ProPresenter Bundle ."
