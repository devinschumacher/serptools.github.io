      "Bosca Ceoil is a novice-friendly music tracker that aspiring chiptune song creators can use to create and play music. To create music, users place notes within one or more musical patterns. They then arrange those patterns into a song. (Users can also adjust several other settings while creating music, including the instrument, chord, and scale used to play a pattern, the number of notes each pattern contains, and each song's beats per minute.)",
      "From Bosca Ceoil's main menu, users can save the songs they've created as CEOL files. Each CEOL file is a plain text file that consists of a comma-delimited list of numbers. This list of numbers specifies the notes and patterns a song contains, the order in which they're arranged, and all of a song's other settings."
