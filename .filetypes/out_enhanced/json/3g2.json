      "The 3G2 format is an updated version of the .3GP format developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). These two formats are similar as they are based on the ISO base media file format, which was designed to be extensible and flexible for interchanging and presenting media. As a result, 3G2 supports many of the same video and audio streams supported by the 3GP format along with additional audio streams, such as SMV, EVRC, EVRC-B, EVRC-WB, and QCELP.",
      "Also, the 3GP format was designed for GSM-based (Global System for Mobile Communications), whereas the 3G2 format was designed for CDMA-based (Code Division Multiple Access) phones. Overall, 3G2 requires less storage, bandwidth, and data usage."
