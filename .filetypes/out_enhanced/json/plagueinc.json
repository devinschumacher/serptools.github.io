      "You will only encounter PLAGUEINC files if you play Plague Inc. You may create a PLAGUEINC file when saving your custom scenario or you may acquire a PLAGUEINC file from another Plague Inc. gamer who is sharing his scenario.",
      "PLAGUEINC files are meant to be opened with the Plague Inc. game. However, users can rename the .plagueinc file extension as .zip and extract the contents with a Zip decompression utility.",
      "Plague Inc. gamers typically use Plague Inc. Scenario Creator to create their custom scenarios. The mobile app is a companion app to the actual game and is available for purchase for Android and iOS devices.",
      "Gamers can also create their own PLAGUEINC files. They must first create the required scenario information files with a plain text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad or Apple TextEdit, and save them as TXT files. Then, the users can compress the TXT files as a single .ZIP archive and rename the .zip file extension with the .plagueinc file extension."
