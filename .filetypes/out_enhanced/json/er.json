      "Gamers who have homebrew-enabled their Wii or use the Dolphin emulator can download and play Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii. When downloaded, the game arrives as a .ZIP archive. Decompressing this archive allows you to view the game's constituent files.",
      "The game's Music subdirectory contains a series of ER files. These files are used to play in-game music and sound effects. Many of the ER files that contain music are named for the level in which they are used."
