      "LPD files are used by the lpd daemon , a service that processes print requests. When a print request arrives, the lpd daemon creates a process that checks both the hosts.lpd file and the hosts.equiv file in the /​etc/​ directory. Using these files, the daemon determines whether the print request is allowed.",
