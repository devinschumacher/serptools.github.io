      "Need for Speed is a car-racing video game series published by Electronic Arts (EA) and originally released in 1994. Over the years, EA has released numerous installments of the game, such as Need for Speed II (1997), Need for Speed: Underground (2003), Need for Speed: Underground 2 (2004), Need for Speed: Shift (2009), and Need for Speed Heat (2019).",
      "Most Need for Speed gamers will not encounter LZC files since they are resource files loaded by the game. However, some gamers that enjoy modifying gameplay may look for LZC files in the game installation directory.",
      "Some Need for Speed installments that are packaged with LZC files include Need for Speed: Underground, Need for Speed: Underground 2, and Need for Speed: Most Wanted. A common LZC file is the GLOBALB.LZC file, which can be found in the \\​GLOBAL\\​ subfolder in the game installation directory."
