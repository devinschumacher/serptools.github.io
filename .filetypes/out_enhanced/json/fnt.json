      "AngelCode Bitmap Font Generator (BFG) allows users to create bitmap fonts from TrueType fonts ( .TTF files). The fonts BFG creates are saved as one or more raster images that contain the font's characters and an FNT file. The FNT file contains data used to extract characters from the raster images.",
      "For example, each FNT file specifies characters' IDs, X and Y coordinates within an associated image, widths, heights, and offsets. When creating a font, users can choose in what format the font's FNT file should be saved. By default, BFG saves FNT files as plain text files. However, users can also choose to save FNT files as XML or binary files."
