      "Google Drive for Desktop is a program that allows Google Drive users to back up and open their Google Drive files on Windows and Mac PCs. While Drive for Desktop stores actual backups of some types of files (such as .JPG and .DOCX files) on users' computers, it does not store copies of files created using Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and other Google Workspace applications. Instead, Drive for Desktop stores shortcut files that, when double-clicked, open the associated file in the web version of the correct Google Workspace application.",
      "GSLIDES files are Drive for Desktop shortcuts that open Google Slides presentations. When a Drive for Desktop user double-clicks a GSLIDES file, the related presentation opens in Google Slides, provided the user is signed in to a Gmail account allowed to access the presentation. Each GSLIDES file is a JSON file that contains a presentation's URL and document ID, as well as the name of the Gmail account used to create the presentation.",
      "NOTE: GSLIDES files were previously created by Backup and Sync from Google. Google replaced Backup and Sync with Drive for Desktop in October 2021."
