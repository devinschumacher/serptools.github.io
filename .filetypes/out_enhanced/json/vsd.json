      "Microsoft Visio allows you to visualize and communicate complex information through technical drawings saved as VSD files. The application is typically used in business settings to create flowcharts, workflow diagrams, organizational charts, software diagrams, network diagrams, and database models.",
      "The VSD format was more common in the 2000s when it was the default format utilized by Visio to save drawings. However, Microsoft replaced VSD files ( binary-based ) and .VDX files ( XML-based ) with the .VSDX format ( Zip-based ) when it released Visio 2013. However, Visio 2013 and later versions still support VSD and VDX files."
