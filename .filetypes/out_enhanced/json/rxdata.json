      "RPG Maker XP allows developers to create custom RPGs without extensive programming knowledge. The program stores all of the resources for a game as a project, which is a structured folder system that includes an .RVPROJ file and other game files, such as maps, characters, events, scripts, and other resources. It also contains a Data folder that holds the RXDATA files for the RPG.",
      "While players do not interact with RXDATA files directly, game developers use them to design and customize their RPGs. Some advanced users may analyze or modify RXDATA files using third-party tools to adjust gameplay elements or create custom modifications.",
      "NOTE: Enterbrain no longer actively develops RPG Maker XP, replacing it with newer software versions, notably RPG Maker VX Ace and RPG Maker MV. However, RPG Maker XP projects still use RXDATA files."
