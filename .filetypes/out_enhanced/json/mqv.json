      "The Sony CLIÃ‰ was a model of PDA that Sony sold from 2000 to 2005. These devices used Palm OS and, among other things, could play videos saved as MQV files (with Sony Movie Player).",
      "Because the devices that create and use MQV video files are obsolete, so is the MQV format. However, you can still open, play, and convert MQV files with several media players."
