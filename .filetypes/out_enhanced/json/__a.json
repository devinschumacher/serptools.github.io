      "FFSJ uses the extensions \".__a,\" \".__b,\" \".__c,\" ..., \"._aa,\" \"._ab,\" etc. when creating encrypted split archives. For unencrypted archives, it uses the extensions \".001,\" \".002,\" etc. All split archive files are created with the same file size. Split archives can be created and reconstructed from multiple directories.",
      "NOTE: FFSJ actually stands for \"Fastest File Splitter & Joiner\" even though the program name is \"File Splitter & Joiner.\""
