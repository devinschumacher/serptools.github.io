      "YML files are most commonly used as configuration files, which define a program or application's settings. If a program uses a YML file as a settings file, you can edit the program's settings by opening and editing the YML file in a text or source code editor. Most settings-related YML files include comments that explain how the file can be used to adjust a program's settings.",
