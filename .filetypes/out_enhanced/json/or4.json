      "IBM Lotus Organizer (which was originally created by the software developer Threadz) was a PIM application that allowed users to input and organize their contacts, calendar, to-do lists, and other information. It was available as both a standalone application and, at times, as part of IBM Lotus SmartSuite.",
      "Version 97 GS, also known as version 4, of Lotus Organizer saved users' information as OR4 files. Version 4.1 of Lotus Organizer also saved users' information as OR4 files. In version 5, IBM replaced the OR4 format with the .OR5 format."
