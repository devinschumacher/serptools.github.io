      "Typically, users never see APK files because Android handles app installation in the background via Google Play or another app distribution platform. However, many websites offer direct APK file downloads for Android users who want to install apps manually. In this case, you should be careful that you trust the source of the APK file, because malware can be distributed in APK files, just as it can in the case of Windows and .EXE files.",
      "You can install APK files manually by following these instructions . Make sure that you trust the source of the APK file.",
      "Windows 11 is the first version of Windows to officially support the ability to install APK files.

How do I create APK files? Android apps are developed using Android Studio, the official IDE for Android software developers. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, and it allows users to develop apps and prepare them for upload to a distribution service, such as Google Play. When apps are ready, developers can build them into APK files and sign them for release. NOTE: See the .AAB description for details on Google's new publishing format for developers.",
