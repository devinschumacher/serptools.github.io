      "You can pair a Bluetooth-enabled Sony Ericsson cell phone with your computer to use the phone as a computer remote control. Each phone includes a default remote configuration, which maps the phone's buttons to computer functions. However, you can customize this configuration using Sony Ericsson Bluetooth Remote Control software.",
      "After creating a custom configuration in Sony Ericsson Bluetooth Remote Control Software, you can save the configuration as an HID file and send it to your phone. Each HID file is a .TAR archive that includes a KCF file and a .JPG file. The KCF file contains XML data that specifies your custom button mapping."
