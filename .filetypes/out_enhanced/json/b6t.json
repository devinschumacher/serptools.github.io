      "B6T files only contain disc track information. Each B6T file is saved along a .B6I file, which contains the actual data stored in the disc image. Opening a B6T file will mount the corresponding BlindWrite disc image (B6I file).",
      "NOTE: BlindWrite 5 saved track information files as .B5I files. Previous versions of BlindWrite used the .BWT file extension."
