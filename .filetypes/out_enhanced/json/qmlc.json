      "Qt is a software development kit ( SDK ) that allows developers to create user interfaces for desktop and mobile applications. Developers using Qt save their source code files, written using the Qt Modeling Language (QML) and JavaScript , in QML files.",
      "At runtime, an application that uses QML files loads the files and compiles them into bytecode . After doing this, the QML runtime saves the bytecode version of each QML file in a QMLC file. The next time the application runs, it can load data from these QMLC files, instead of having to reload and recompile the associated QML files."
