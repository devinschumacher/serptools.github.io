      "The OPJ file is the most common file type associated with Origin since it is used as a container for projects. You can open OPJ files with Origin and you can also open OPJ files with Origin Viewer, a free, lightweight program that allows you to view and copy information in OPJ projects.",
      "To open an OPJ file in Origin, select File → Open... , select the \".opj\" file type, navigate to the OPJ file location, and click Open .",
      "To save an OPJ file in Origin, select File → Save project or Save Project As... , name the file, choose the save location, and click Save .",
      "NOTE: The release of Origin 2018 included an updated unicode format for saving projects ( .OPJU ), which features performance advantages over the older, non-unicode OPJ file format."
