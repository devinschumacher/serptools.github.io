      "Unreal Engine games reference textures in UTX files to apply detailed images to 3D models, making characters, objects, and arenas look more realistic. Most gamers will not encounter UTX files unless they are attempting to modify elements within a game. For example, they may edit textures in a UTX file to create new looks for characters or redesign environments."
