      "Developer Tom Preston-Werner created the open-source TOML format in 2013. Each TOML file consists of plain text key-value pairs that define a program's settings. Typically, related settings are divided into sections denoted by bracketed text (e.g., [New Section] ).",
      "Many programs use one or more TOML files to store and load their settings. Users can edit these files to adjust the associated program's settings to their liking.",
      "NOTE: TOML files are formatted similarly to .JSON and .YAML files. However, TOML is designed to be easier to read and understand than JSON and YAML."
