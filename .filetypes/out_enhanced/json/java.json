      "JAVA source code files are compiled into .CLASS files using a Java compiler ( javac command). A CLASS file contains bytecode that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM can be downloaded for every major operating system, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.",
      "NOTE: Android programs are written in Java but are run using the Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM), which is a different virtual machine than the standard JVM that is optimized for Android."
