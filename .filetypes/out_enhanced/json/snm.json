      "Netscape Messenger and Collabra were used primarily in the late 1990s and early 2000s when Netscape was a popular web browser and software suite. Netscape Messenger (part of Netscape Communicator, later renamed \"Netscape Browser\") allowed users to send, receive, and manage email, much like modern email clients, such as Outlook or Thunderbird.",
      "Netscape Collabra allowed users to subscribe to and participate in discussions within various newsgroups across the Internet. Messenger and Collabra users likely never encountered SNM files since the programs automatically created, updated, and referenced them in the background."
