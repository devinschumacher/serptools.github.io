      "With previous versions of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed, you could double-click a JNLP file to run the program to which it pointed. These versions of JRE included JWS technology.",
      "However, with the release of Java Platform Standard Edition (JSE) 9, Oracle deprecated JWS. In JSE 11, Oracle removed JWS support altogether. Therefore, current versions of JRE do not support JNLP files. If you want to continue using JNLP files to launch and manage Java applications, you can do so using OpenWebStart, an open-source implementation of JWS, which can be used alongside current versions of Java."
