      "MOGRT templates are used to make reproducing similar motion graphics with similar themes and content more time efficient. These templates are created in After Effects, which is a motion graphics video program, to be opened and inserted into a project in Premiere Pro, which is a video editor. Although these templates are created in After Effects, they cannot be opened by After Effects.",
      "You can create an MOGRT template by using the \"Essential Graphics\" panel in After Effects. To access the panel and create a template, select Window â†’ Essential Graphics , modify the template, and click Export Motion Graphics Template... .",
      "After Effects comes with default templates for sports, news, and video gaming theme packages. These MOGRT templates are located in the \"Essential Graphics\" folder, which is in the \"Adobe After Effects CC [year]\" installation folder.",
      "NOTE: MOGRT templates replaced .AECAP templates in Adobe Creative Cloud (CC) 2017. AECAP templates were used by versions 14.0 and 14.1 of After Effects. However, Adobe soon replaced AECAP templates in later versions of After Effects with MOGRT templates."
