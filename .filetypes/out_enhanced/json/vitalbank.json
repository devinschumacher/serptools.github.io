      "Vital is a cross-platform synthesizer program developed by Matt Tytel. Vital allows musicians to record music, typically using an electronic musical keyboard, and mimic all sorts of instruments and sounds as they do so.",
      "To give musicians a starting point from which to begin recording music, Vital allows them to install and select from presets that mimic certain instruments and musical styles. These presets are saved in VITAL files. Groups of related VITAL files are often saved in VITALBANK files, which a musician can use to install several presets at once. For example, a group of punk-related presets may be saved in the file Punk Rock.vitalbank .",
      "When Vital users share custom presets with each other, they typically group related VITAL files into VITALBANK files. To create VITALBANK files, users select the Export Bank option from Vital's sandwich menu."
