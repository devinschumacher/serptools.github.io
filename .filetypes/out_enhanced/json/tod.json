      "Recent versions of other video-editing programs may also be able to import TOD files (see below). The included Cyberlink PowerDirector application can import TOD files and export them as .MPG files, which are viewable by most video-editing programs.",
      "NOTE: Some JVC Everio cameras save video files with a .MOD extension, which is similar to the TOD format."
