      "The SVF format conforms to the Joint Test Action (JTAG) standard, which is also known as the Standard Test Access Port and Boundary-Scan Architecture. SVF files are stored in an ASCII text format and can be edited with a text editor.",
      "SVF files are often used by automatic test equipment (ATE) that attach to debug ports within PLDs to perform the tests. PLDs that do not have debug ports often provide other mechanisms for stepping through logic tests.",
      "NOTE: Serial Vector Format files may also be stored in a binary format in .XSVF files."
