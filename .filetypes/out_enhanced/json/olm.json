      "OLM files are used only by Mac Outlook and can't be opened by the Windows version of Outlook because the Windows version uses .PST files rather than the OLM format. To open OLM files in Windows, you can first convert the OLM file to the PST format with Aryson OLM to PST Converter and then open it with Outlook.",
