      "Physicists and other scientists use TEM to create cross sections, spectrum, and diffraction images of ultrathin specimens. DigitalMicrograph saves the TEM images it creates in various proprietary file formats, including the DM4 format.",
      "Notably, the DM4 format includes support for spectrum images, while DM3 and earlier DigitalMicrograph formats do not. As a result, DM4 files can sometimes have much larger file sizes than DM3 images."
