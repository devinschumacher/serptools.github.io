      "SCML files are used by BrashMonkey Spriter as project files that can be modified, saved, and reopened for further modification. The files store all the configuration information for the animation, which includes the paths to the assets, XY pivot information for each asset, and the timeline of the animation. When packaged with a game, the game references the SCML file to play the appropriate animation.",
      "Since SCML files are saved in XML format, you can also open and modify them using a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad or Apple TextEdit. However, be careful what you edit because SCML files store paths to assets, such as .PNG and .DB files that make up the animation. If you break these paths, the animation will no longer appear correctly in the game."
