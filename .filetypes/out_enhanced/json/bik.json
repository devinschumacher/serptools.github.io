      "Bink videos can be played with Windows Media Player (WMP) if you have the Windows 7 Codec Pack installed. Even though WMP says it does not recognize the \".bik\" extension after you have installed the codec pack, choose to open the video anyway and WMP will play it.",
      "BIK files are often compressed from .AVI , .MOV , or other common video file formats. When compressed with the Bink tools, the data rates can be adjusted for resolutions as low as 320x240 up to resolutions in HD quality, thereby supporting videos that are suitable for handheld devices as well as HD TVs and computer screens."
