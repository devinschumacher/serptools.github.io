      "Many professional-grade digital cameras save photos as camera raw files. These files contain all the data captured when a photographer took a picture. Retaining this data in its raw form allows photographers to edit elements of the image, such as its color temperature and exposure, more precisely than they'd be able to if the data was processed or compressed.",
      "Minolta Dimage cameras, such as the Dimage 7 and Dimage Z2, save camera raw images as MRW files. When Sony acquired Minolta, they phased out the MRW format and replaced it with the .ARW format."
