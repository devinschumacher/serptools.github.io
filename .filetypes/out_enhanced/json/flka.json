      "FLKA files are referred to as Portable Lockers. Folder Lock also supports Basic Lockers ( .FLKB extension), which do not have the 4GB file size limit, but they cannot be used with NewSoftware's online backup service.",
      "NOTE: The FLKA and FLKB extensions were introduced with Folder Lock 7. Prior versions of the software use .FLK files for lockers."
