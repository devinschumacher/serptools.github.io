      "zBot is a Geometry Dash mod that allows players to record and play back their gameplay. Players can also use zBot to slow down Geometry Dash's gameplay, making levels easier to complete (and successful replays easier to record).",
      "After a player finishes creating a replay, they can choose to save it in a ZBOT file. zBot saves ZBOT files in the ~/​Geometry Dash/​replays directory. Any player who has zBot installed can load a ZBOT file to play the replay it contains."
