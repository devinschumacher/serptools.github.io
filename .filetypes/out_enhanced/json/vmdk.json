      "Workstation and Fusion are virtualization applications that enable you to run multiple guest operating systems, including Windows and Linux, as virtual machines (VMs) on your computer. When creating a VM, the software creates various files to configure and run the VM. One of the files created is the VMDK file, which functions similarly to the Windows C:\\â€‹ drive.",
      "To locate the VMDK file, right-click the VMWAREVM file, and choose Show Package Contents . The VMDK file is typically named after the operating system. For example, the VMDK file for Windows 11 may be named Windows 11-0.vmdk .",
      "Other files that make up a virtual disk may include: [vmname]-s[###].vmdk - for split virtual disk files. [vmname]-f[###].vmdk - for split files with disk space allocated in advance. [diskname]-[###].vmdk - stores changes made to a virtual disk. NOTE: Early versions of VMware software saved virtual disks as .DSK files.",
