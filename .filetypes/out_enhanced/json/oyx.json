      "Approach Software Corporation initially developed Lotus Approach, a relational database management system ( RDBMS ) that Lotus Development Corporation acquired in 1994. Lotus included the software in Lotus SmartSuite, a productivity suite that also featured Lotus 1-2-3 (spreadsheet), Word Pro (word processor), and Freelance Graphics (presentation software). IBM later acquired Lotus Approach and eventually discontinued the software, making the OYX file obscure."
