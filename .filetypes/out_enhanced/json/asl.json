      "As a Photoshop user edits an image, they can apply visual effects that alter how the layers their image contains appear. For example, a user could apply an outline and drop shadow effect to a text layer, to set the text apart from the rest of their image. If a user plans to apply the same set of effects to multiple layers, they can save that set of effects as a layer style, or ASL file.",
      "Users can see the layer styles they have access to by selecting Window â†’ Styles from Photoshop's menu bar. The Styles window will then appear in Photoshop.",
      "To apply a style to a layer, select the layer from the Layers tab, and then select the style you want to apply from the Styles window. The effects the style contains will be applied to the layer.",
      "To save a set of effects as a layer style:",
      "To export a layer style, select and right-click the style in the Styles window. Then, select Export Selected Styles... . Photoshop will ask where you want to save the exported style.",
      "After you export a style, you can share it with other Photoshop users to allow them to apply that style to their Photoshop layers."
