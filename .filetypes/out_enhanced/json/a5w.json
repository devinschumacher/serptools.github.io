      "A5W files contain standard webpage code as well as source code written in using Alpha Five syntax. The Alpha Five source code is demarcated by the open and close tags <%a5 and a5> . When a user's Web browser requests an A5W webpage, the Alpha Five server parses the Alpha Five source code and then returns the resulting webpage to the user's browser.",
      "NOTE: Since A5W files are webpages, you may see a trailing \".a5w\" in your browser's URL when going to an Alpha Five application page, similarly to how you would see a trailing \".html\" for a plain HTML webpage."
