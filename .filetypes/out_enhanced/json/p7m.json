      "Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) is an email encryption and digital signature standard. It is used to encrypt sensitive messages and verify senders' identities. For example, businesses might use S/MIME encryption to protect confidential medical or financial information sent via email.",
      "To use S/MIME, you must install an S/MIME certificate and link it with your email client, such as Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail. If your email client is not linked to a valid S/MIME certificate, messages encrypted or signed using S/MIME will contain a P7M file. Most often, this file is named smime.p7m ."
