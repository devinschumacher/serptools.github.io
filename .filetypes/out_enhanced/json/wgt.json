      "The data stored in WGT files is classified as \"weighted data,\" which is data adjusted to better represent a population or group (commonly used in census analysis, polling, and market research to improve accuracy and reliability). For example, data collectors can assign a weight to correct for biases, such as an underrepresented or overrepresented group, to ensure that the results more accurately reflect the real-world population they are studying.",
      "The U.S. Census Bureau developed IMPS to assist with data entry, editing, tabulation, and analysis, making it a valuable tool for researchers and government agencies. It was widely used in the 1990s and 2000s, but the U.S. Census Bureau discontinued it in favor of the Census and Survey Processing System (CSPro, making the WGT format obscure."
