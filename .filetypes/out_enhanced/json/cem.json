      "Children of the Nile, also known as Immortal Cities: Children of the Nile, allows players to construct buildings, issue edicts, and tend to citizens' needs in an ancient Egyptian city. It is part of the City Building series, which includes other historical city-building games like Caesar, Pharaoh, and Zeus: Master of Olympus.",
      "In CotN, players interact with various people, animals, buildings, and other objects. The 3D models used to show these objects are saved as CEM files. For example, a CEM file might contain a 3D model of an obelisk.",
      "NOTE: The game Empire Earth also uses CEM files. Empire Earth's CEM files are formatted slightly differently than CotN's CEM files."
