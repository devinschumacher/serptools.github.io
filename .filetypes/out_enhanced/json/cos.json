      "When image adjustments are made, Capture One saves a COS file that has the same name as the original image but with the added \".cos\" extension. For example, if you make adjustments to myphoto.jpg , Capture One saves a myphoto.jpg.cos file. When final adjustments are made, you can process, or \"bake,\" the settings and photo together into an output image with all adjustments applied."
