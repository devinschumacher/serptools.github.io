      "Karsten Obarski initially developed the Amiga module format and released it with the Ultimate Soundtracker software for the Commodore Amiga system in 1987. As music trackers began supporting the format, especially on PCs in the 1990s, other developers released variations of the MOD format.",
      "Initially, the MOD format only supported four audio channels and sixteen instruments. However, recent MOD variations have increased the number of supported channels to 32 and supported instruments to 31.",
      "The sound samples within a module are assigned to different tracks and are played back according to the notes in the score. A MOD module also includes a list that tells the application playing the module the order the patterns are to be played.",
      "NOTE: MOD files may be created by various MOD trackers, including FastTracker, StarTrekker, Noise Tracker, MilkyTracker, and Cog ."
