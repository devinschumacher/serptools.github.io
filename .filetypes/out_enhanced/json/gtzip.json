      "GT Designer Advanced is a utility included with StudioCoast vMix. You can create titles or lower-third graphics with GT Designer Advanced, then import them into vMix to be displayed during a production, such as a sporting event, newscast, or church service.",
      "To create a GTZIP file with GT Designer, select File â†’ Save As . After saving the title, GT Designer creates a GTZIP file to store the title or lower-third graphic information. The GTZIP file is a working file, which means you can close the file, re-open it, then continue modifying the title or lower-third graphic.",
      "NOTE: You can also save a title or lower-third graphic created by GT Designer as a GTXML file, which stores its information in the XML standard."
