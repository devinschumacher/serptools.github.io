      "Friday Night Funkin' is a rhythm game in which players engage in rap battles against opponents. Kade Engine is a Friday Night Funkin' mod that adds additional features to the game, including the ability to automatically save replays of a player's gameplay. Whenever a player completes a level, Kade Engine produces a KADEREPLAY file that contains a record of how the player completed the level. The KADEREPLAY file describes, in human-readable text, what buttons a user pressed when."
