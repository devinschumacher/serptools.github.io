      "Microsoft introduced the Excel Open XML Spreadsheet (XLSX) format when it released Excel 2007. Since then, XLSX files have become one of the most common file types for saving data in spreadsheets, and as such, are now typically referred to as just Excel spreadsheets.",
      "In Excel 2007, XLSX files replaced .XLS files as the standard file for saving spreadsheets in Excel. Unlike XLS files, which store spreadsheet data in a single binary file, XLSX files are saved in the Open XML format, which stores data as separate files and folders in a compressed Zip package. The archive includes the [Content_Types].xml file, which describes the spreadsheet, and an .XML file for each worksheet within the spreadsheet.",
      "Each cell in an XLSX spreadsheet may be formatted individually. For example, cells may have a number, text, currency, or another format, as well as color, border style, custom font, and size. Cells may also reference other cells to compute a resulting value.",
      "NOTE: To explore the contents of an XLSX file, you can change the .xlsx extension to .zip and then decompress the resulting file with any Zip decompression utility."
