      "LMP, or lump, files typically contain a single game asset, such as a 2D image. Quake and Doom .WAD files are comprised of several of these lumps, packaged into a single archive .",
      "While most LMP files contain 2D images, some contain other types of game data. For this reason, Quake and Doom modding programs that can open some LMP files may not be able to open others."
