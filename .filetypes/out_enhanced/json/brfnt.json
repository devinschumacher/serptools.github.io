      "You will most likely only encounter BRFNT files if you navigate the game resource files of a Nintendo Wii game after dumping it from a game disc. You can find BRFNT files stored in Wii Game Data .SZS files in the game resource files.",
      "For example, 6 BRFNT files are stored in the Font.szs file in the Mario Kart Wii game. The files store various font-related information, such as the type of numbers that appear in different game modes and the style of characters used for Mii names."
