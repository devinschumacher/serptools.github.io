      "MXCS files are used to overlay a color scheme onto different zoom levels of a generated fractal image. They can also be reused for applying the same look and feel to multiple images. MXCS files are stored in an XML format.",
      "NOTE: Color scheme files were previously saved with the .FRC extension in Mandelbrot Explorer version 2.5 and earlier."
