      "DOCX files store data in the Open XML Document format, which was introduced with Microsoft Word 2007. It replaced the .DOC file format as the standard format for saving documents in Word. Unlike DOC files, which store document data in a single binary file, DOCX files save data as separate files and folders in a compressed Zip package. Within a DOCX file are XML files and three folders: Word , docProps , and _rels , which store the content, document properties, and relationships between the files.",
      "The Open XML format is designed to make document content more open and accessible. For example, document text is saved in plain text files, and document images are stored as individual image files, such as .JPG or .PNG , within the DOCX file. The included files may also contain page formatting information, authorship data, and document review notes.",
      "NOTE: To explore the contents of a DOCX file, rename the .docx extension to .zip and then decompress the resulting file with any Zip decompression utility."
