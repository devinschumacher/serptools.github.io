      "AviaGames publishes several mobile games that allow users to play for cash prizes. Some of these games include Bingo Clash, Solitaire Clash, Bingo Tour, Bubble Buzz, and Zumania. Many of these games can be accessed via the Pocket7Games mobile app (which is available for download in the Apple App Store and as an .APK file for Android devices).",
      "After a user installs an AviaGames game(s), the game produces an AVIADATA file. This file contains information the game uses to identify the user, so they can log in to the game. It also contains metadata about the user, such as when they installed the game, if they've actually played the game, and if they've registered and accepted the AviaGames license."
