      "Most users that play Ninja Kiwi games will not see MODE files since MODE files are typically stored inside the \"GameModeDefinitions\" folder in the \"Assets\" folder of a Ninja Kiwi game installation. These files should not be moved from their location.",
      "MODE files are meant to be referenced by Ninja Kiwi games and are not meant to be opened. However, since MODE files are saved in plain text, they can be opened by a text editor."
