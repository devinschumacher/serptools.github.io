      "GLSL is a high-level shading language with syntax similar to the C programming language. It is utilized by Open Graphics Library ( OpenGL ), an application programming interface ( API ) that renders 2D and 3D graphics featured in applications across different platforms. Various applications utilize OpenGL for rendering graphics, including Minecraft, Adobe After Effects, Blender, and Avogadro.",
      "Shaders give depth to 3D graphics through the alteration of their appearance, which includes defining the levels of color, light, darkness, hue, saturation, and contrast of the graphic. For example, adjusting the angle of light on a surface and the proximity of the light are two examples of how shading can modify the appearance of a graphic.",
      "The shaders run on a computer's graphics processing unit ( GPU ), which reduces the workload of the computer's central processing unit ( CPU ). By relieving the CPU of the task of rendering graphics, the CPU can focus its resources on executing application code.",
      "There are two prominent types of GLSL shaders:"
