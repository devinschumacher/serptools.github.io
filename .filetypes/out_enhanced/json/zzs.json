      "Scrabble players (and other wordsmiths) use Zyzzyva to look up, study, and quiz themselves on words. In Zyzzyva's Search mode, users can create and execute word searches that include a variety of conditions. For example, a user can create a search that returns only words that have between two and six anagrams.",
      "If a user plans to review to a search's results regularly, or they want to use the search to create a Zyzzyva quiz ( .ZZQ file), they can save that search as a ZZS file (by selecting Save Search... in the Search window). Each ZZS file contains all that search's conditions, written in a plain text, XML format."
