      "SWF (pronounced \"Swiff\") files were commonly used to bring animated graphics, video, and sound to the web in the 2000s and 2010s. They were also a popular means of delivering browser-based games. SWF was originally an acronym for Shockwave Flash, since the SWF format was designed for Shockwave Player. However, as SWF files became a standard means of publishing Flash content on the web, the acronym was modified to instead mean Small Web Format.",
      "Content developers primarily used Adobe Flash (now Animate), Flash Builder , and After Effects to create SWF animations. The files could be played by the free Flash Player or with a web browser that had the Flash plug-in installed.",
      "However, as web technologies improved, Flash became increasingly criticized for its shortcomings, which included performance and security issues. Adobe and many web browser developers officially ended support for Flash on December 31, 2020.",
      "NOTE: FutureWave and Macromedia first developed Flash in the 1990s; Adobe Systems acquired Macromedia in 2005."
