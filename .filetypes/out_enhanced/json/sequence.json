      "Online Sequencer is a music sequencer that musicians can access in their web browser, at onlinesequencer.net . It allows musicians to place notes upon a grid to create a song. While creating a song, musicians can also adjust the song's time signature, BPM, playback instrument, and other settings.",
      "After creating a song, musicians can choose to save the song online or download it to their computer. Downloaded songs are saved as SEQUENCE files. Musicians can also download other users' songs as SEQUENCE files from the Sequences section of Online Sequencer's website."
