      "Embarcadero Delphi is an integrated development environment ( IDE ) that creates Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Linux applications. Developers use DPL files to extend Delphi applications by dynamically loading and linking libraries at runtime . This is particularly useful for component-based development, where custom user interface ( UI ) elements, database drivers, or other functionality can be packaged separately and integrated as needed, which makes development more efficient by reducing redundancy and ensuring consistency across projects..",
      "NOTE: Versions 3 and earlier of Delphi used DPL files until Embarcadero Technologies replaced them with .BPL files in version 4."
