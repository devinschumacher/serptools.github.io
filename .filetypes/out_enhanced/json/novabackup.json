      "Nova Launcher is an Android app that allows users to replace the operating system's default home screen with a custom home screen of their own design. For example, users can use Nova Launcher to customize their home screen's icon themes, or to update old Android devices' home screens to include features available on newer devices.",
      "If a user wants to back up and/or share their Nova Launcher-created home screen with another Nova Launcher user, they can save the screen as a NOVABACKUP file. Other users can load the NOVABACKUP file as their initial home screen when they first open Nova Launcher, or they can import the NOVABACKUP file into Nova Launcher using the app's Import option."
