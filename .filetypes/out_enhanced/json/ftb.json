      "FTB files were introduced with the release of version 8 of MyHeritage Family Tree Builder. The files are saved in an SQLite database format, which is more efficient than the Zip-compressed .ZED and .UZED database files it replaced. ZED files are primarily used by versions 1 - 6 of Family Tree Builder and UZED files are primarily used by version 7 of the software.",
      "To create an FTB file with Family Tree Builder, select File → New Project... . The software automatically saves modifications to the project database. Family Tree Builder saves FTB files by default in the following directory:",
