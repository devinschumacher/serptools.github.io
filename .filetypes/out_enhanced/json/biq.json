      "Civilization, or Civ, is a series of turn-based strategy games in which players attempt to guide a civilization to worldwide dominance. Civilization III, the third game in the series, was released in 2001. Civ 3's second expansion, Conquests, was released in 2003.",
      "Conquests introduced a new feature, fittingly named Conquests, that allowed players to play short, multiplayer-focused scenarios. These scenarios, often referred to as conquests, were set in a specific place and period of history, such as the Rise of Rome, the Fall of Rome, or Japan's Sengoku period. Each conquest was saved as a BIQ file.",
      "Players could use Conquest's scenario editor to create their own BIQ files. The final version of Civ 3, known as Civilization III: Complete, also included the Conquests feature and the Conquest scenario editor."
