      "The PZFX file replaced the .PZF file in version 5 of Prism. The original PZF file was saved in binary format whereas the PZFX format saves all of the data tables and info sheets in XML format and the rest of its information, such as graphs, layouts, and results, in a format only readable by Prism.",
      "Some advantages of the PZFX format over the PZF format are: Useful for data interchange Approximately 10% smaller in size More secure for baking up as much of the data is in plain text GraphPad Prism is a popular application used in medical centers and pharmaceutical companies by biologists and physical and social scientists. It is also used by students at universities. The application provides scientific-graphing tools and biostatistics that allow you to analyze data and generate graphs that can be published to .DOCX documents, .PPTX presentations, and websites.",
