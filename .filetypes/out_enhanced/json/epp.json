      "TalaPhoto enables home users and hobbyists to create digital photo albums for various purposes, including printing, emailing, building photo-based websites, and generating slideshows. The EPP file keeps track of all the elements involved in the project, including formatting preferences and visual arrangement, which makes it easier to resume editing or exporting the project later."
