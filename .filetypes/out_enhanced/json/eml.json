      "Microsoft developed the Electronic Mail (EML) format to comply with the industry-standard RFC 5322 for transferring messages between email clients. EML utilizes the Internet Message Format (IMF) syntax for text stored in the messages.",
      "Because of its wide adoption among email clients, EML has become one of the most common email message formats. Some other common email message file types include .MSG .MBOX , .EMLX and .DAT .",
      "Since the EML format is widely supported, you can save emails as .EML files with most email applications. Two common email applications that can save messages as EML files include Microsoft Mail and Apple Mail:"
