      "Despite what the name of the Print to File checkbox may lead you to believe, PRN files do not simply contain a copy of the document you want to print. Instead, they contain page layout information and other instructions that one specific type of device can use to transfer your document to a printed page. If you want to create a usable copy of your document using the Print dialog box, do not select the Print to File checkbox. Instead, use the Print to PDF option to create a .PDF copy of your file.",
      "If you do end up creating a PRN file, you can print it using the printer or other device you selected as you created the file. For example, if you use the same type of printer at home as you do at work, you might want to create a PRN file at home, bring it to your workplace, and print your document from your work printer. Large print shops sometimes use PRN files to print their customers' files, without needing to have access to the proprietary software that created the file."
