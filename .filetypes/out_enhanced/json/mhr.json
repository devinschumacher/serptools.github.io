      "Geometry Dash is a multiplatform game in which players click in time with music to jump a cube over obstacles. Mega Hack v7 Pro is a modding tool available for the Windows version of Geometry Dash. Among other things, Mega Hack v7 Pro allows players to control the game's speed and record their game actions as a macro. They can then replay their macro at normal (or faster) speed to create level speedrun videos, which are often referred to as botrun or bot videos (because the player is not manually controlling their cube during these videos).",
      "Optionally, players can save the Mega Hack v7 Pro macros they create as MHR files (using the Save option found in the app's Macros section). This allows them to share the macros they've created with other Mega Hack v7 Pro users.",
      "NOTE: Absolute Mods Ltd released Mega Hack: Mobile , a mobile port of Mega Hack Pro, in March 2023."
