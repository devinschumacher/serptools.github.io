      "EncryptOnClick is a free encryption program that allows users to compress and encrypt their files, allowing them to store and transfer files more easily and securely. When a user encrypts a file with EncryptOnClick, the program creates a password-protected EOC file that contains a copy of the original file. The user (or another user who has access to EncryptOnClick and knows the password used to encrypt the file) can restore the file to its original, unencrypted state by decrypting it in EncryptOnClick."
