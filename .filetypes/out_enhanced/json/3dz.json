      "3DZ files are not meant to be opened on a computer. They were created for Gateway 3DS, which is software stored on a microSD card that is inserted into a Nintendo 3DS. However, if you rename the \".3dz\" extension to \".3ds\", and remove the header in the file, the ROM may be playable by 3DS emulators, such as TronDS or Citra."
