      "Developers use Superbase to create databases and applications used to manage and report on those databases. For example, a developer might create an app that can, among other things, show reports of a company's current inventory to end users.",
      "To create reports that appear to end users, developers use Superbase's Report Designer. These reports use queries saved in SBQ files to retrieve the data they show."
