      "WMF files originally appeared in 1988 when Microsoft released Windows 2.0. Microsoft later published the WMF file format specification with the Windows 3.0 release in 1992 and published a subsequent specification in 2006. Microsoft continues to publish updates to the format regularly.",
      "WMF is primarily used as a container for vector graphics and supports raster image data. In addition, it supports 16-bit image data that can be scaled and output at a higher definition, which is especially useful when modifying graphics in an image editor and printing high-quality images.",
      "The WMF format stores image data in a series of metafile record structures. Each of these records stores drawing commands, object definitions, and configuration settings.",
      "WMF was common in the 1990s, especially in Windows applications, such as Microsoft Word, Publisher, and PowerPoint. However, due to its 16-bit data limitation and device dependence, Microsoft replaced WMF with the Enhanced Windows Metafile ( .EMF ) format in 1992 when it released Windows NT 3.1.",
      "Image editors may still save vector graphics as WMF and EMF files. However, the Scalable Vector Graphics ( .SVG ) and Encapsulated PostScript ( .EPS ) formats have largely replaced the formats.",
      "NOTE: Microsoft developed the .WMZ and .EMZ formats to reduce the file sizes of WMF and EMF files and make it easier to transfer the graphics between applications. These formats utilize gzip compression to compress the files."
