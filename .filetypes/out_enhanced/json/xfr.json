      "XFR files contain code that is run by the iProcess Engine. Examples of XFR processes include automatically forwarding new hire information to an HR department, running payroll for all employees, and adding new support tickets to the support database.",
      "If a specific process is not available within an iProcess model, a custom XFR file can be created or imported into the program. Processes may also be exported as .XPDL files, which are supported by Business Studio and other BPM programs."
