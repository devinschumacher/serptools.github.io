      "Respawn Entertainment is an American video game developer that is part of Electronic Arts (EA). They've developed several popular games, including the Titanfall series and Apex Legends.",
      "Titanfall 2 and Apex Legends both store game data in STARPAK files. This data is used to load in-game characters, objects, animations, and sounds. While most players will never encounter a game's STARPAK files, modders may want to extract, modify, and repackage the assets a STARPAK file contains, to modify the associated game."
