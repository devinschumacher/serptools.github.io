      "You will only encounter TEMX files if you use Cemetery Registry to manage cemetery information. The software comes packaged with a TemNyilv.temx database file which is duplicated and renamed by Cemetery Registry when a user creates a new database in the program. The TemNyilv.temx file can be found in the following directory, which is the installation location of the Cemetery Registry:",
      "C:\\​Program Files (x86)\\​CEMETERY REGISTRY [version]",
      "You can open a TEMX file with Cemetery Registry by selecting Open file in the program. You can also open it with Microsoft Access since the file is saved in a similar format as MDB database files.",
      "NOTE: Cemetery Registry is only available in the Romanian and Hungarian languages."
