      "Because the YAML format is not language-specific, YAML files can be included and referenced within programs written in any language that supports YAML libraries, such as C/C++, Ruby, Python, Java, Perl, C#, and PHP. The YAML acronym originally stood for Yet Another Markup Language, but as the YAML format evolved, the acronym adopted its current, recursive meaning.",
      "If a program uses a YAML file as a settings file, you can edit the program's settings by opening and editing the YAML file in a text or source code editor. Most settings-related YAML files include comments that explain how the file can be used to adjust a program's settings.",
      "NOTE: While the programmer community recommends saving YAML files with the YAML extension, you might also encounter YAML files saved using the .YML extension."
