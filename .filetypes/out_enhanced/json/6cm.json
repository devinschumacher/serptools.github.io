      "Fasttracker is obscure, but fans of retro game music and sound effects may still use the program and 6CM format. The format is an extension of the standard four-channel Module ( .MOD ) format by adding two more channels for managing additional audio elements, such as instruments or effects, to create multi-layered audio."
