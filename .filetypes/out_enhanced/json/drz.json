      "Draz Paint is an image editor that was created by Devil (of the Noice and Fantastic 4 Cracking Group demo groups) and updated by Jer (of the Panic demo group). It allowed users to create, edit, and save simple color bitmap images.",
      "Typically, Draz Paint saved the images that users created as DRZ files. Some Draz Paint images instead use the .drp extension.",
      "NOTE: Various versions of Draz Paint are still available for download online. However, to use Draz Paint, you must run it on a Commodore 64 or in a Commodore 64 emulator."
