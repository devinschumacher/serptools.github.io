      "Avro was developed within the Apache Hadoop project, which is an open source platform used to store and process structured, semi-unstructured, and structured data without any format requirements. Avro is utilized in Apache Hadoop as a serialization format for persistent, or infrequently accessed, data. Since it stores data in a compact binary format, the Avro format is especially useful for the exchange of extremely large datasets.",
      "NOTE: Avro can also be accessed as a data source by Apache Spark SQL."
