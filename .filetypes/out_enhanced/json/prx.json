      "You can restore a PRX file to the original P3 files by renaming the \".prx\" extension to \".exe\" (which changes the file to a self-extracting .EXE file) and then opening the EXE file to extract the P3 files.",
      "NOTE: Primavera P3 was originally developed by Primavera Systems, who was acquired by Oracle. The P3 software, originally released in 1994, was discontinued December 31, 2010."
