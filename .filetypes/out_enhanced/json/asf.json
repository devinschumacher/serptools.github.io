      "The ASF container format only specifies the structure of how the audio or video streams online, which depends on various factors, such as network bandwidth and server performance. In addition, the ASF format does not specify the codec used to encode the audio or video stored in the ASF container format.",
      "While the .asf file extension may be used for media files saved in the ASF format, the .wma and .wmv extensions are more commonly used. If the ASF container format stores audio, it is typically saved as a Windows Media Audio ( .WMA ) file. It is typically saved as a Windows Media Video ( .WMV ) file if it stores video. Audio and video data stored within these files may be compressed using a variety of video codecs."
