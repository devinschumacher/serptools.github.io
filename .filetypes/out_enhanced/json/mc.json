      "Molecular Constructor is a 3D molecule builder that allows users to design molecules and optimize their geometry. In the mobile versions of Molecular Constructor, users' molecules are saved as MC files. While MC files are used to show 3D images in Molecular Constructor, the files are actually text files. When you open an MC file in a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad, Apple TextEdit, or GitHub Atom, you can read the coordinates of each atom a Molecular Constructor molecule includes. You can also see the bonds the molecule includes.",
      "Mobile Molecular Constructor users can use the program's File â†’ Save feature to save their molecules as MC files and share them with other users. MC files can be opened in both the Android and iOS versions of Molecular Constructor and, according to the program's developers, will soon be supported in the program's Windows desktop version."
