      "Since the Nintendo Wii, most of Nintendo's game consoles have allowed players to create avatars known as Miis. Some games also include Mii NPCs. Miis are saved in a variety of file formats, specific to the console for which they were created.",
      "The Nintendo 3DS uses Miis saved as CFSD files. These Miis are nearly identical to the .FFSD format Miis used by the Nintendo Wii U. The only difference between the CFSD and FFSD formats is that CFSD files' fourth byte is always set to 30, to identify them as 3DS Miis, while FFSD files' fourth byte is set to 40, to identify them as Wii U Miis.",
      "NOTE: The website MiiLibrary.com hosts a database of official CFSD files."
