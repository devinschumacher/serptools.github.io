      "The CSV data exchange format is supported by many personal, business, and scientific programs. The format is especially useful in transferring tabular data between programs and databases because of its wide support.",
      "The file is also helpful for transferring data saved in a proprietary format, such as an .XLSX file, into another program that does not support the XLSX format. For example, you can export financial data in an XLSX file opened in Microsoft Excel to a CSV file to upload it to an online financial management service. Or, you can export thousands of contacts from an email service to a CSV file then import the file into an address organizer or another email service."
