      "RAD Game Tools created the Bink container format to store video and audio used in video games. Most commonly, gamers may encounter Bink videos that are saved as .BIK or .BK2 files. Less commonly, gamers may encounter Bink audio files that are saved as BINKA files.",
      "Games for a variety of platforms, including PC, Mac, Xbox, Playstation 2 and 3, and the Nintendo Wii U, use Bink audio and video files. For example, both the PS3 and Wii U versions of Minecraft use audio saved as BINKA files."
