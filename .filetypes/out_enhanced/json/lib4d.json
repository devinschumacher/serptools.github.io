      "Cinema 4D is an application for Windows and macOS that creates realistic images and graphics for movies, games, architectural design, and motion graphics. Additionally, Cinema 4D users can share and transfer multiple presets organized into libraries (and saved as LIB4D files). However, Maxon discontinued the format when it replaced the \"Content Browser\" with the \"Asset Browser.\"",
      "In earlier versions of Cinema 4D, the LIB4D Preset Library files that came with the application were located in the \"browser\" folder inside the \"library\" folder, which was located with the application. If you double-click the LIB4D file, the \"Content Browser\" window will open up where you can see a hierarchy of the different LIB4D files. You can create a new preset library by selecting File → New Preset Library... , naming it, and clicking OK .",
      "When using the application interface, you can insert an object preset from your preset library. Select File → Load Object Preset from the menu on the right side of the interface, navigate to your object and select it. You can also save an object preset into your library from this same area by selecting Save Object Preset... from the same menu."
