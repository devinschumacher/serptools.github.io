      "The Ketron DJL Compiler allows audio enthusiasts to create DJ loops for use with the Ketron Midijay Live Audio Player. Each loop is comprised of eight WAV files: an Intro, Arrs A - D, a Fill, a Break, and an Ending.",
      "When a user selects DJL Compiler's Compile button, the program compiles the WAV files a user has selected into a single DJL file. The program also produces a DJL Compiler Report, which shows a log of the compilation process. The user can then transfer their compiled DJL file to their Midijay Live Audio Player."
