      "BitTorrent and uTorrent are peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing programs used to send and receive torrents . While both applications are available for free, upgrading to the paid, licensed version of the applications removes ads and adds other premium features.",
      "When a user purchases a paid version of BitTorrent or uTorrent, they are sent an installer and a license key. The license key is saved in a file named license.btkey . After installing the app, a user must drag their BTKEY file to the app to activate their license."
