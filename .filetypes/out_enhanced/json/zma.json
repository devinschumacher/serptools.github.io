      "SPL Tracer was a small Windows utility during the late 1990s and early 2000s designed to help speaker enthusiasts and audio engineers convert printed or scanned speaker measurement graphs, such as frequency response and impedance plots, into digital data formats like FRD and ZMA. Users could then import these formats into speaker design and simulation tools, most notably Speaker Workshop, a now-discontinued Windows program developed by Audua for designing and testing loudspeakers.",
      "NOTE: Both SPL Tracer and Speaker Workshop are no longer actively maintained or available for download."
