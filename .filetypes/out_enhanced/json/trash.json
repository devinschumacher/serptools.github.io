      "In December 2022, Google added a Trash folder to ChromeOS's Files app. From the Trash folder, users can restore deleted files (for up to 30 days after deletion).",
      "To ensure users can restore deleted files, ChromeOS retains a copy of those files in a hidden .Trash folder, located within the Downloads folder. ChromeOS also creates related .TRASHINFO files in this folder, which record:",
      "Trashed files are stored at .Trash/​files . TRASHINFO files are stored at .Trash/​info . Users will not see the .Trash folder or its subfolders unless they've chosen to show hidden files (by selecting Show hidden files from the Files app's three-dot menu)."
