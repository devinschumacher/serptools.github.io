      "Temper-studios designed the GRAPH format to be easy to parse and read. GRAPH-formatted data consists of nodes that can contain values or child nodes. For example, a GRAPH node might look like this:",
      "node { a {101}}",
      "Most GRAPH files consist of multiple nodes. In many cases, these nodes define a video game save state, which is a record of a player's in-game progress."
