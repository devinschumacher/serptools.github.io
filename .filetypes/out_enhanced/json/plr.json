      "In Terraria, players explore an open world, construct buildings and other structures, and battle a variety of creatures. Before players start playing, they must create a player profile. While creating this profile, they specify their character's following information:",
      "Terraria then saves the profile as a PLR file. As the player progresses through the game, Terraria also records the player's maximum HP and MP, current item inventory, current buffs, and other data to their PLR file.",
      "The desktop versions of Terraria store PLR files in the following directories:",
      "NOTE: Terraria also saves backups of each player profile. These .BAK files use the .plr.bak extension and are saved in the same directory as PLR files."
