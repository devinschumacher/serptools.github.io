      "The Zip format was created in 1989 by Phil Katz and was used in the PKZIP utility developed by PKWARE, Inc. The format grew in popularity and is now supported by most file compression/decompression programs.",
      "You may encounter ZIP files in various ways, such as receiving compressed files via email from a friend or co-worker, downloading files online, or exploring backup files that have been compressed with Zip compression. Both Windows and macOS come with programs that can compress and decompress ZIP files.",
      "Windows users can create ZIP archives by right-clicking a file and selecting Send to → Compressed (zipped) folder . macOS users can create ZIP archives by right-clicking a file and selecting Compress \"[filename]\" ."
