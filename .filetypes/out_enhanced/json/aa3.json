      "Sony developed the ATRAC compression algorithms and released them in 1992. ATRAC first appeared in the MiniDisc data storage format (a format meant to replace the cassette tape, but the CD quickly surpassed it).",
      "ATRAC underwent several updates throughout the 1990s and 2000s. However, few audio players or devices adopted the format outside of Sony audio devices (like the Walkman) and Sony's discontinued Connect Music Store. Sony eventually ended the development of ATRAC codecs in 2008.",
      "NOTE: Audio files compressed with ATRAC compression often bear the .aa3 file extension, but they may also be saved in the OpenMG Audio container with the .oma ( .OMA file) or .omg ( .OMG file) file extensions. Additionally, .AT3 files use the ATRAC3 codec."
