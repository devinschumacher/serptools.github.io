      "Certain Wii game disk image management tools, such as Wiimms WBFS Tool and Wii Backup Manager, allow gamers to save Wii games as WBFS files. Gamers can use these files to play games on their Nintendo Wii, using the homebrew program USB Loader GX, or in a Wii emulator, such as Dolphin.",
      "However, due to limitations in previous versions of USB Loader, WBFS files can be no larger than 4GB. So, when a WBFS creation tool is used to save a game that is larger than 4GB, the tool creates both a WBFS file and a WBF1 file. The WBF1 file contains any game data that did not fit into the WBFS file. To play a game created this way, a player must have access to the game's WBFS and WBF1 file."
