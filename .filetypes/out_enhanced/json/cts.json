      "TreeSheets is an open-source program that allows you to create hierarchical spreadsheets. These documents may contain a combination of spreadsheets, mind maps, outlines, to-do lists, calendars, and even small databases. For example, a hierarchical spreadsheet may contain the results of a product brainstorming session, followed by a to-do list of steps to start creating the product.",
      "TreeSheets saves the hierarchical spreadsheets it produces as CTS files. These files are saved in a proprietary format, so they can be opened only in TreeSheets. However, TreeSheets users can also export their spreadsheets as .HTML or .JSON files, for use in other programs."
