      "DreamForge Intertainment was an American game developer that was founded in 1990 and dissolved in 2001. In that time, DreamForge released 15 video games, including Chronomaster and Anvil of Dawn.",
      "Chronomaster was a science-fiction adventure game in which players had to restore two pocket universes from a state of temporal stasis. Anvil of Dawn was a fantasy RPG in which players were teleported to the war-torn world of Tempest to confront an evil conquerer. Both games used DFA videos for their cutscenes."
