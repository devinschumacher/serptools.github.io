      "In 1999, Microsoft introduced the WMV video codec (along with the WMV Screen and WMV Image codecs) as part of the Windows Media framework. The WMV codec is the most well-known codec of the three and is utilized to compress .ASF videos, transforming them into WMV files.",
      "Due to the popularity of Windows, the WMV format became one of the most common video formats in the 2000s. It could be streamed over the Internet and played with various media players, commonly those bundled with Windows.",
      "In addition, YouTube allows users to upload WMV videos, and Windows Media Player's default video file format is WMV. Also, some users may encounter DRM-enabled WMV files downloaded via a commercial video service that they can only play on the device that downloaded it.",
      "However, as Windows Media Player's popularity has waned, and as developers have created cross-platform video file formats that rival WMV files' compression ratio, WMV files have fallen out of favor. As a result, MPEG-4 Video ( .MP4 ) files are now much more popular than WMV files."
