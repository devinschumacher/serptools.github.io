      "SBV timestamps are formatted using the H:MM:SS.000 time format. These start and end timestamps correspond to playback times in the video the SBV file is intended to caption. The caption paired with each start and end time appears during that time period.",
      "SBV files are similar to .SUB and .SRT files. YouTube recommends that novice caption creators create caption files using the SBV or SRT formats, since those formats are quite basic."
