      "INPROGRESS files are created and deleted in the background without user visibility. However, in the unlikely even that a backup fails, there may be an INPROGRESS file left over. For the safety of backed up data, it is best to consult an Apple representative to fix this issue.",
      "NOTE: INPROGRESS files are stored in the Mac OS X package format. Therefore, if necessary, you can right-click the file and select \"Show Package Contents\" to manually view the backup data within the package."
