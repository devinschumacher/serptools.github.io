      "ConceptDraw DIAGRAM is a Windows and macOS diagramming application for amateur and professional users. You can create various types of technical drawings, from a simple flowchart of an assembly line to a complex diagram detailing photosynthesis.",
      "The CDS file format allows you to open your .CDD document immediately in Presentation mode (simply by double-clicking the CDS file). It is also helpful for sharing presentations with others.",
      "CDS was the default format for saving diagram slide shows in ConceptDraw PRO before CS Odessa replaced it with the CDSZ format when it released version 10 of the software and renamed the app to ConceptDraw DIAGRAM). While CS Odessa replaced the format, the app can still save diagram slide shows as CDS files (select File → Save As... , then choose ConceptDraw SlideShow from the \"File Format\" dropdown menu)."
