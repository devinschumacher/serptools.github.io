      "Mine-imator is a program that allows players to create animated movies using Minecraft assets, including characters, items, textures, and terrain. Animators can then export their movies as .MP4 , .MOV , or .WMV videos, so they can share them via YouTube and other online video platforms.",
      "Whenever an animator creates a new Mine-imator animation, they also create a new, associated MIPROJECT file. While MIPROJECT files are primarily used to open animation projects in Mine-imator, the files are actually just text files, which contain references to the assets used and actions that occur within a movie, as well as other metadata ."
