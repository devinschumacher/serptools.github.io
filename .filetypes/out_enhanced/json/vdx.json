      "With Microsoft Visio, users can create flowcharts, layout diagrams, organizational charts, and other types of shape-based drawings. Prior to Visio 2013, users could save the drawings they'd created as VSD or VDX files.",
      "In Visio 2013, Microsoft replaced both the VSD and VDX formats with the .VSDX format. Thus, VDX files are less common now than they were prior to 2013. However, Visio and many other diagramming programs can still open VDX files."
