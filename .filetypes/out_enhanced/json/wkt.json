      "The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) created the WKT format as part of their Simple Features Access standards. These standards specify common storage and access models for geographic features, especially 2D geometric features. Many GIS programs can import and export files saved in Simple Features Access formats, such as WKT.",
      "Most WKT files contain a series of points, lines, and/or polygons that map areas of interest on an accompanying geographic map. For example, a WKT file might contain polygons that describe the shape of a city's voting districts. These points and shapes are specified in plain text, using number-based coordinates. Geometries can consist of single points, lines, and polygons or multiple points, lines, and polygons linked together."
