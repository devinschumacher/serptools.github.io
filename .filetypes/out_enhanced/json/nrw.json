      "NRW files are similar to .NEF files saved in the Nikon Electronic Format but are designed to support Windows Imaging Component (WIC) functions. Additionally, NRW files are often large (typically 22MB or more) since they store 12-bit RGB CCD-RAW camera information at a high resolution in an uncompressed format.",
      "The large amount of image data saved in an NRW file enables you to edit the image's color, shadows, brightness, warmth, and contrast more accurately. Also, NRW files store image adjustments separately from the image data, which means you can undo changes you apply to the image.",
      "NOTE: To capture images in the NRW format on a COOLPIX camera, select the NRW or RAW option in the camera menu."
