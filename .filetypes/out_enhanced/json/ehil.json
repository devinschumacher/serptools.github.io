      "Evozi HTTP Injector Lite allows you to create an encrypted link between your Android device and an outside network. You can then browse the Internet while connected to the outside network, so your browsing history is linked to the network's IP address instead of their own.",
      "Using HTTP Injector Lite also allows you to access websites that have been blocked by your ISP 's firewall. As such, the app and its EHIL files are popular in countries that restrict or monitor their populace's Internet access."
