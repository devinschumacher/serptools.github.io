      "You may encounter PDF files in various ways, whether downloading a document from a website or receiving a document from a co-worker or friend as an email attachment. PDF files also preserve fonts and formatting electronically across multiple platforms and appear the same on the screen as when printed on paper.",
      "You may create PDF files with various programs, including word processors, image editors, and PDF file utilities like Adobe Acrobat. You may also create PDF files from documents using the Print dialog in Windows and macOS.",
      "For example, in Windows, you can select File â†’ Print... or click the printer icon to open the Print dialog within an application. Then, select Microsoft Print to PDF from the list of available printers in the Print dialog box and click Print to create the PDF file. In macOS, you can choose Print... from the application's File menu, and then select Save as PDF... from the PDF dropdown menu in the window.",
      "NOTE: View the PDF definition for more information."
