      "Scitex (now Scailex) is a multinational company that produces equipment used in the graphic design, printing, and publishing industries. The company created the Scitex Continuous Tone image format for use with its high-end graphics processing workstations.",
      "Other image editors and graphic design apps used in the publishing industry can also save images as SCT files, so the images can be opened on Scitext workstations. For example, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator can both save images as SCT files.",
      "NOTE: Infrequently, SCT files are instead saved with the .CT extension."
