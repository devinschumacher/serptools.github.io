      "UPEK developed Protector Suite QL in the 2000s and commonly bundled it with laptops and devices with UPEK fingerprint scanners. The fingerprint technology authenticated users seeking to access files and folders encrypted as FDP files via the MySafe feature in the software. Without fingerprint authentication, the encrypted contents of FDP files are inaccessible.",
      "NOTE: In 2010, AuthenTec acquired UPEK, which ceased the development of Protector Suite QL. Apple Inc. then acquired AuthenTec in 2012."
