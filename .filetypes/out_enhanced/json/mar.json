      "Mozilla programs automatically download and run MAR files, so the typical user will never manually open a MAR file. However, MAR files can be used to manually update a Mozilla program without opening it, which can be useful for system administrators.",
      "The Mozilla development team generates nightly builds for their software products that include a MAR update package. Therefore, users can apply software updates with the latest release each day.",
      "NOTE: MAR files created by the Mozilla team use the filename convention [program]-[version].complete.mar and [program]-[version].parial.mar for complete and partial software updates."
