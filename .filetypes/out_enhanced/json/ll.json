      "LLVM is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. Primarily, developers use LLVM to optimize programs written in a variety of programming languages for one or more target architectures.",
      "As part of this optimization process, LLVM compiles a program's original source code into an intermediate representation, which consists of a translated version of the program's original code. This translation is saved in an LL file. Developers can compile LL files using LLVM's static compiler to optimize them for a specific architecture."
