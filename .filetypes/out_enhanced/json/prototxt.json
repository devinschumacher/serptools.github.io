      "Caffe (Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding) is a deep learning framework that allows users to create image classification and image segmentation models. Initially, users create and save their models as plain text .prototxt files. After a user trains and refines their model using Caffe, the program saves the user's trained model as a CAFFEMODEL file.",
