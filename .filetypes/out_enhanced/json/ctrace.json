      "System tracing allows Android users and developers to record information about their device's activity and performance. Developers can use this information to review, troubleshoot, and optimize an application's performance. For example, a developer might discover that their app opens and maintains too many threads, causing a device's performance to suffer.",
      "Android 9 and earlier versions use a system tracing tool called Systrace to perform and record traces. Traces saved using Systrace-based tools, such as the System Tracing app, are saved as CTRACE files.",
      "NOTE: In Android 10 and later versions, Android uses a system tracing tool called Perfetto to save traces as .PERFETTO-TRACE files."
