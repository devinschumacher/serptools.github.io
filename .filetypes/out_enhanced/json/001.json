      "When an archive has a large file size (e.g. because it contains hundreds or thousands of files), users may choose to split that archive into several smaller pieces, to make it easier to store and share with others. For example, a user who cannot email a large .ZIP archive may split that archive into several smaller files that they can then email.",
      "These split archives are often saved as a set of files that use the .001 , .002 , .003 , etc. extensions. A split archive's 001 file typically contains identifying metadata that file archiving and joining utilities use to extract files from or reconstitute the split archive. However, to successfully extract files from or stitch together a split archive, you usually must possess all of that split archive's constituent files, not just its 001 file.",
      "NOTE: Some archive utilities produce split archive files that use compound file extensions. For example, 7-Zip's split archives use the .7Z.001 , .7Z.002 , and so on extensions."
