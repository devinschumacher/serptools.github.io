      "Help & Manual was designed to make it easier for developers and technical writers to create consistent, structured documentation across multiple platforms. Users can create help pages and save them as HM3 projects to preserve their progress, and then export them to several different help formats, including WinHelp ( .HLP ), HTML Help ( .CHM ), WebHelp, and .PDF .",
      "NOTE: EC Software released version 3 of Help & Manual in the early 2000s, and later versions of the software replaced HM3 files with the .HMX and .HMXZ formats, which offered improved XML-based data structures and additional features."
