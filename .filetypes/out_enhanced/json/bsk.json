      "BSK files are created in SecurDisc by moving the mouse randomly, which generates data for the key. Once created, the key can be used for digitally signing files. A corresponding public key is also generated in a .BPK file, which can be distributed to recipients of the disc for verifying the authenticity of the disc contents."
