      "Ace Attorney is a popular visual novel series in which, primarily, players take on the role of defense attorney Phoenix Wright. In these games, players question witnesses and attempt to secure their clients' freedom. Periodically, players can make objections, which are not actual procedural objections, but instead dramatic statements about a flaw in a witness's testimony.",
      "Objection.lol Objection Maker is an online tool that allows users to make their own Ace Attorney objection videos. These videos can star nearly any Ace Attorney character, who typically states their objection across one or more frames. Users can also edit each frame's text speed, background music, included Ace Attorney speech bubble, and other settings.",
      "If a user wants to save a local copy of their Objection Maker project, they can select Project â†’ Save . Doing so will save the user's project as an OBJECTION file, which they can re-open in Objection Maker at a later time if they so desire."
