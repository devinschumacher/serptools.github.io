      "DipTrace consists of four modules: Schematic Capture Editor PCB Layout Editor Component Editor Pattern Editor The DIP file is the main file type associated with the PCB Layout Editor. The module allows you to design the layout of your PCB then save it in the DIP file. When you finish designing your PCB layout and verify that it is valid, you can order it through DipTrace. To do this, select File → Order PCB → Place Order are used for printing the physical PCB.",
