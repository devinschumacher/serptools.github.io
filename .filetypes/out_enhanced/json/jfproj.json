      "You will only encounter a JFPROJ file if you use Microsoft Font Maker for creating fonts. When you save a font, Microsoft Font Maker creates the JFPROJ file to store the information about the font. You can close and re-open the JFPROJ file at a later time to edit it.",
      "To create and save a JFPROJ file with Microsoft Font Maker, click the \"Save\" icon in the upper-right corner of the program. To open a JFPROJ file with Microsoft Font Maker, click the \"Open\" icon in the upper-right corner of the program. When you are done editing a font with Microsoft Font Maker, you can export it as a .TTF file, which can be installed in Windows or macOS and used as a font in various programs, such as Microsoft Word and Adobe Photoshop.",
      "NOTE: JFPROJ files store project information in JSON format."
