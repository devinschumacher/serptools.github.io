      "OPL2 FM synthesizers were used to play music for video games in the 1980s and 1990s. Yamaha produced several FM chip types along with the OPL2 (YM3812) chip, such as OPL (YM3526), OPL3 (YMF262), and OPL4 (YMF278B) chips. Winamp with the Ganbatte! plug-in installed allows users to emulate OPL2 audio chips in Windows."
