      "Autodesk formed a consortium of several companies named Industry Alliance for Interoperability in the 1990s to develop the IFC format. They released the first version of the IFC format in 1996 and have since released many revisions throughout the years (and changed their name to BuildingSMART in 2005).",
      "They developed the IFC file format to be platform-neutral, allowing interoperability between BIM programs utilized in architecture, engineering, and construction industries. As a result, most any BIM program, whether proprietary or open source, can open an IFC file."
