      "Several audio cards and MIDI players can play audio samples saved as SF2 or SBK files. These files typically have large file sizes, which can make sharing them with other musicians difficult.",
      "If a musician wants to send several SF2 or SBK files to another musician, they can package the files as a single, compressed SFARK archive. The other musician can then use sfArk to decompress the archive and access the sound banks it contains."
