      "An audio envelope is a way to shape the characteristics of a sound over time by controlling how a sound starts, develops, and fades through modifying parameters, such as volume, pitch, or filter frequency. In relation to MadTracker 2, MTE files help shape sound dynamics, making them useful for genres like chiptune, electronic music, and demoscene compositions.",
      "Yannick Delwiche developed MadTracker 2, and it became a popular tracker-based DAW in the early 2000s. However, modern alternatives, such as Renoise and OpenMPT , have largely replaced it. Since MadTracker 2 is no longer actively developed, MTE files are obscure. Tracker enthusiasts who continue working with the software or revisiting older projects are likely the only users encountering MTE files."
