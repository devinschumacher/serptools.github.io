      "The Design Web Format was developed as a device-independent and resolution-independent drawing format for distributing designs. It is not intended to replace popular CAD formats, but instead, is used to save designs in a more accessible, open format that can be opened without the need to purchase expensive CAD software. The format is based on the HOOPS Stream (HSF) 2D/3D format but is also Zip-compressed.",
      "DWF files can include one or many design sheets. Because the files are highly-compressed, they're easy for engineers and designers to share over the Internet (thus the name Design Web Format)."
