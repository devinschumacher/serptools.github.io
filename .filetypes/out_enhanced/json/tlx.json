      "Hotels, hospitals, and other businesses with publicly-accessible commercial LG TVs often configure those televisions to function in Free-To-Guest mode. FTG mode limits what channels and settings a user has access to, so they cannot use the TV in an unauthorized manner.",
      "If a FTG TV user wants to transfer one TV's settings to another, they can do so by:",
      "Each TLX file contains a list of channels a TV is allowed to access, as well as a list of settings that users are allowed to access. TLX files are model-specific, so a TLX file produced by one TV may not function correctly if used with a different model.",
      "In addition to exporting and installing TLX files on LG commercial TVs, TV administrators can create, edit, and open TLX files in LG's free Free-To-Guest File Manager, which is available to download from LG.com."
