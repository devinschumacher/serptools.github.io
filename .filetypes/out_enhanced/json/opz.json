      "FlipViewer FlipBooks are typically comprised of an OPF file, which lists and organizes the FlipBook's contents, and many content files. Optionally, users can instead save a FlipBook as a zipped OPZ file. Doing so compresses the FlipBook's contents into a single file, making it easier to share the FlipBook with other FlipViewer users."
