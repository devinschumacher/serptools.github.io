      "In 2004, Apple created the Apple Lossless Audio Codec. Like FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec), ALAC is used to losslessly compress audio files. However, ALAC-encoded files typically have smaller file sizes than FLAC-encoded files (created from the same audio).",
      "Primarily, Apple music applications, such as Apple iTunes and Apple Music, use ALAC to losslessly compress and deliver audio to users. However, because ALAC is just a codec, and not an audio container format, these ALAC-encoded files are typically saved as M4A (MPEG-4 Audio) files. If a file uses the .alac extension, it is likely a misnamed M4A file."
