      "ITHMB files can store up to 25 thumbnail images. Each thumbnail image is linked to a larger image, which is also located on the device. When a user clicks one of the thumbnail images, the larger version of the thumbnail is opened.",
      "NOTE: Since the ITHMB file format is not widely supported, the file can be converted into other, more widely supported image formats using programs such as PicsAid and File Juicer."
