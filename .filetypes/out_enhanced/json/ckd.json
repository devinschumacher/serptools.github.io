      "The CKD format was first used by CADKEY Workshop V20 in 2001. However, CADKEY was bought by Kubotek and renamed KeyCreator in 2003. Since the acquisition, KeyCreator has saved models and drawings as CKD files, by default.",
      "To create a CKD file with KeyCreator, select File → New or New by Template , then select File → Save . After saving the file, you can close it, then re-open it to continue designing the drawing or model.",
      "To export a CKD file with KeyCreator, select File → Export , then choose the format. Some possible formats you can export CKD files to include .PDF , .STL , .OBJ , .DXF , .JPG , .TIF , and .GIF ."
