      "A drawback to delivering apps via Google Play is that the size of an app's APK file must be 50MB or smaller, which forces app developers to use other files (such as OBB files) to store additional graphics and media assets. Because of this limitation, some developers make their apps available from sites other than Google Play. The XAPK format was introduced to package the APK file and OBB file together for a seamless delivery and installation process when downloading an Android app from a non-Google Play site.",
      "In addition to an app's APK and OBB files, each XAPK file contains a manifest.json file. This manifest file lists metadata about the app the XAPK file includes. APKPure and other XAPK installers use this metadata to unpackage and install the XAPK file's components."
