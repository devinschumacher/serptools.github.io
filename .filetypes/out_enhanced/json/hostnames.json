      "The Archive Team is a team of volunteers dedicated to preserving Internet content that might otherwise be deleted. As part of their website archiving process, the Archive Team often uses a script to catalog all the hostnames associated with a multi-hostname website. This script generates a HOSTNAMES file.",
      "Each HOSTNAMES file contains a list of serial numbers paired with a list of the hostnames associated with a website. The file is then used in a later step of the archiving process to retrieve the data stored at each hostname."
