      "RIS created the RIS format to allow for standardized exchange of citation information between digital libraries. The files are saved in a standard, human-readable plain text format, to make them easy to open, read, edit, and manage.",
      "An RIS file may contain one or more citations. Each citation must begin with the TY tag, which denotes the type of publication from which the citation was drawn. For example, the text TY - JOUR denotes that the citation references a journal article. Typically, each citation then goes on to include the cited work's author ( AU ) or A1 ), title ( TI or T1 ), publication date (often divided into multiple sections for year and month), and other metadata . In multi-citation RIS files, each citation ends with the tag ER ."
