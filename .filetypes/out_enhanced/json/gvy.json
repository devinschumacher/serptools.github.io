      "Groovy is a programming language closely related to Java, which makes it easy for Java users to learn Groovy. Other programming languages besides Java have influenced Groovy, like Python and Ruby . Some features of the language include compact syntax so code is easier to read and compatibility with Java classes and libraries."
