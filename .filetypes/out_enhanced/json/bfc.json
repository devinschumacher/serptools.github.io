      "The functionality Briefcase provided was helpful before cloud storage and network file sharing became common, as it provided a simple way to keep files consistent between a user's desktop and a laptop. it was included with Windows 95 and remained available in later versions, but it became obsolete as more advanced file-syncing solutions, such as OneDrive, emerged.",
      "Microsoft officially removed support for Briefcase when it released version 1703 of Windows 10 in April 2017. While BFC files may still exist on older systems, they are no longer actively used or supported in modern Windows environments."
