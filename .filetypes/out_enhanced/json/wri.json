      "Microsoft Write was included with Windows 1.0 to Windows NT 3.51. With the release of Windows 95, Microsoft discontinued both Write and the WRI file format, and replaced Write with Microsoft Wordpad.",
      "Because Microsoft Write has been discontinued for decades, WRI files are now uncommon. However, several word processing programs can still open WRI files."
