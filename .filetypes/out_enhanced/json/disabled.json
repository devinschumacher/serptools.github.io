      "Many Minecraft Java Edition players install mods that add additional features and functionality to the game. Players may install and manage these mods, which are saved as .JAR files, using Forge, Fabric, or MultiMC. Typically, mods are stored in the following directory:",
      "C:/​User/​AppData/​Roaming/​.minecraft/​mods",
      "If a player wants to disable a previously-installed Minecraft mod, one of the easiest ways to do so is by changing the file's extension so Minecraft does not recognize the file as a valid mod file. Most often, players and mod management applications disable mods by adding the .disabled extension to the end of the mod's file name. For example, if a player disables a mod using MultiMC, the program automatically appends .disabled to that mod's file name."
