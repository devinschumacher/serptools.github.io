      "FaxMaster is a server-based fax and OCR tool that allows users to scan printed material, typically paper documents, save them as images, and send them as faxes to fax machines worldwide. However, in 1993 Caere Corporation discontinued the FaxMaster software to focus on other OCR-related endeavors. Since its discontinuation, files related to FaxMaster, such as DPB and .INM files, have become antiquated."
