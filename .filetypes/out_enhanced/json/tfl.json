      "CardioPerfect Workstation is a cardiopulmonary data management system that allows clinicians to log and analyze the results of various cardiopulmonary tests, such as blood pressure tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and more. Optionally, CardioPerfect Workstation can connect with a healthcare organization's electronic medical record (EMR) software, which allows clinicians to import test reports, results, and links into a patient's record.",
      "To establish this connection to their EMR, CardioPerfect Workstation users must install the FileLink plug-in, included with CardioPerfect Workstation. After doing so, they can attach CardioPerfect Workstation reports (saved as .PDF or .TIFF files), test results (saved as .XML files), and test shortcuts to a patient's record.",
      "The shortcuts FileLink creates are saved as TFL files. Each TFL file points to a specific CardioPerfect Workstation test. Double-clicking a TFL file will open the associated test in CardioPerfect Workstation (provided CardioPerfect Workstation is installed on and the test is accessible from the clinician's computer).",
      "NOTE: Welch Allyn was acquired by Hillrom which was then acquired by Baxter."
