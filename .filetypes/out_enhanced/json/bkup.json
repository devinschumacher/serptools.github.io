      "If you discover a BKUP file on your computer, it most likely was created by a program that is, or was, installed on your computer. BKUP files are typically created in a folder located in the installation directory of the program that created it.",
      "NOTE: One example use of BKUP files is with cPanel and WHM, a web server management software, which uses BKUP files for Awstats server traffic logging."
