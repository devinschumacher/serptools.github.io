      "The Cerber virus is packaged as a trojan horse in order to trick the user into installing it on their computer. It may be distributed through a fake website or a link in an email. Once the virus is opened and installed, it takes over the computer, encrypting files (documents, pictures, videos, etc.) and appending the \"cerber3\" extension. The files can only be opened once the user pays the ransom, usually Bitcoin , to the creator."
