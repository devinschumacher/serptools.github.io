      "The Presentation program comes bundled with several DPT templates and allows you to download a large amount more directly through the application. The templates can be used for school presentations, business summaries, seminars, and other presentations that are often replicated. DPT templates can also be converted to other presentation files such as .POT , .POTX , .PPT and .PPTX files.",
      "The WPS Office suite is similar to the Microsoft Office suite but is available for free. WPS Office offers four main tools that are available in one module:",
      "Presentation enables you to design a slide by applying themes, choosing fonts and colors, and inserting images, video, audio, charts, tables, equations, and shapes. You can also add transitions, make speaker notes, and rehearse slide timings for presentation purposes."
