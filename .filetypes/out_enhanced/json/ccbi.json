      "Developers use the Cocos2d framework to create 2D and 3D video games. CocosBuilder is a discontinued visual editor available for macOS; it allows Cocos2d developers to create game scenes. For example, a developer might use CocosBuilder to visually create and edit their game's levels.",
      "Before a developer can include a scene created using CocosBuilder in a game, they must export that scene as a CCBI file. This file is a binary file, which the developer will reference while coding their game in Apple Xcode."
