      "Apple developed the QuickTime File Format for use with now discontinued the QuickTime media framework. Each QTFF file can contain video, audio, and text data. For example, a QTFF file might contain a movie, the movie's audio track, and subtitles.",
      "While most QTFF files are saved with the .mov or .qt extensions, some are saved as QTM files. You can open and play these files the same way you would MOV and QT files."
