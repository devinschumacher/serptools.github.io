      "Harmony Assistant comes packaged with many default instruments saved in MUI files. Each instrument file consists of a recording of an instrument playing a specific note and parameters to tell the program how it should be played.",
      "In Harmony Assistant, you can create instruments other than the default ones packaged with the software by editing an instrument and selecting Save predefined instrument in the Action contextual menu. You can also define the parameters of the instruments such as the note range, sound attack rate, decay, volume release, and loop release."
