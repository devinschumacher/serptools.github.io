JPG files commonly contain digital photographs, drawings, or graphics. On most devices, you can double-click or double-tap a JPG file to open it in your default image viewer.\n\n\nMore Information\n\n\n\n\nJPG file open in Microsoft Photos\n\n\nIn 1992, the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) finalized and released the JPEG file format. Most notably, the JPEG format uses lossy compression to greatly reduce an image's file size with little loss in image quality. This makes it easy for users to store several hundred or thousand JPEGs, transfer them between devices, and share them via email and the internet.\nDue to its utility, JPEG has become by far the most common digital image format. Many digital cameras and image editing programs save photos, drawings, and graphics as JPG files, and most every modern PC and smartphone includes a default image viewer that can open JPG files.\nIs there a difference between JPG and JPEG files?\n\nThere is no difference between JPG and JPEG files. Both are images saved in the JPEG format. The reason many JPEG files use the .jpg extension is that early versions of Windows limited file extensions to three or fewer characters. Thus, JPEG images saved in Windows could not use the .jpeg extension, and they used .jpg instead.\nSince Win"
