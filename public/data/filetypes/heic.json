This reduces the amount of space photos take up on memory cards and mobile devices.\nIn 2017, with the release of iOS 11, Apple made HEIF the default photo storage format for iOS devices. With this change, iPhones and iPads began saving users' photos as HEIC files.  When Apple added HEIF support to iOS, they also added HEIF support to macOS, with the release of High Sierra.\nWhen you export or send a photo captured with an iOS device's Camera app to a non-iOS device or application, the photo is typically converted from an HEIC file to a JPEG or .JPG file. For example, when you upload an iPhone photo to Twitter or send it in an email, the photo is automatically converted to a JPEG.\nHow to capture photos a"
