It replaced the .DOC file format as the standard format for saving documents in Word.  Unlike DOC files, which store document data in a single binary file, DOCX files save data as separate files and folders in a compressed Zip package.  Within a DOCX file are XML files and three folders: Word, docProps, and _rels, which store the content, document properties, and relationships between the files.\nThe Open XML format is designed to make document content more open and accessible.

Word is also available for Android and iOS devices.\nYou can also open DOCX files with other word processors, but some of the formatting of the original documents may be lost.
