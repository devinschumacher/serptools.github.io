Then, they must create an EXZMANIFEST file in that folder. The EXZMANIFEST file describes, using JSON-formatted directives, how the EXZ launcher should execute the associated program.","After creating their EXZMANIFEST file, the developer zips the folder and renames the resulting .ZIP file to use the .exz extension. Then, the developer can use their EXZ file with the EXZ launcher."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"exz.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
