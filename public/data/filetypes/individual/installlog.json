When installutil.exe is run against an assembly, it typically creates the following three files:","A YourAssemblyName.installlog file is created only if a developer omits the /LogFile option from installutil.exe , or the developer includes the option along with a custom file name for the INSTALLLOG file (e.g. /LogFile=MyInstallLogFile.installlog ). If a developer includes the /LogFile option without specifying a filename, a YourAssemblyName.installlog file is not created."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"installlog.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
