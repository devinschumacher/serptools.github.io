The WiiConnect24 feature was introduced with the release of the original Wii in 2006, then discontinued in 2013, with the release of Wii U.","After the discontinuation of WiiConnect24, the channels included with the service, such as Forecast and News were no longer available and VFF files were not as commonly used. However, several Wii gamers developed RiiConnect24 to re-use many of the discontinued services on the Wii."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vff.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
