Earlier versions of Valve Hammer Editor saved maps in the .MAP format, which is still used in some cases for interoperability. However, the VMF format is a more structured format that allows modders to easily edit, share, and troubleshoot maps before compiling them into the playable BPS format used by the game engine."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vmf.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
