{"slug":"xma","extension":"xma","name":"Xbox Media Audio File","category":"xbox-media-audio-file","summary":"","developer_org":"microsoft","developer_name":"Microsoft","more_information":{"description":["The XMA format is based on the Windows Media Audio (WMA) format. It was originally conceived by Henrique Malvar before Microsoft took over the development of the format to compete with .MP3 files. The XMA format was then introduced as a variation of the WMA format to store audio used by Xbox 360 video games.","You will most likely only encounter an XMA file if you are attempting to extract music, character voice clips or sound effects from a video game. Because the audio files are not meant to be played outside of the game, they are not supported by media players.","However, there are several programs that can convert XMA files to more widely supported audio formats, such as iDealshare VideoGo and ToWav."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"xma.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
