The SX OS is custom firmware that allows you to play Nintendo Switch Homebrew and XCI backup files. XCI files require master keys to decrypt them so they should only be used if you own the game.","XCI files may also be played using Switch emulator , such as Yuzu or Ryujinx, but they must be decrypted to .NRO files.
