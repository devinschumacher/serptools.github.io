After creating an app, an Authorware user could publish the app via CD, DVD, or a network, for use by students, employees, and others.","Version 7 of Authorware saved users' eLearning app projects as A7P files. Saving an app as an A7P file allowed a user to edit their app at any time, even after publication. For example, if a user found an error in one of their eLearning lessons, they could open their app's A7P file, fix the error, and republish their eLearning app.","NOTE: Adobe discontinued Authorware after the 2007 release of version 7."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"a7p.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
