However, NSP files can be quite large, so players sometimes have difficulty sharing them with one another.","To solve this issue, nicoboss and other members of the Nintendo Switch community developed the NSZ file format. Using the nsz compression program, Switch players can compress large NSP files into smaller NSZ archives. They can then share these archives with other players, who can decompress the archives using nsz and open or install the resulting NSP file. Some custom Switch firmware, such as Awoo-Installer and GoldBricks, allow players to install NSZ files without decompressing them first."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"nsz.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
