You can then add fixtures, furniture, wall colors, and more to your design, which is all stored in the LH3D file when you choose to save ( File â†’ Save... ). You can also save the project as an .LHZD file, which is similar to the LH3D project but saved in a compressed format and is better for storing projects or sharing them across different platforms.","When you are finished, you can export the LH3D file to other file formats, such as .PDF , .JPG , .BMP , .PNG , .TIFF , .SKP , .DAE , ZAE, .3DS , .FBX , .WRL , .X3D , RIB, .OBJ , .SCN , SCNZ, and USDZ.
