The format is text-based and straightforward, which is one reason why many programs use it. However, the simple format structure may also lead to huge OBJ file sizes if they store large and complex 3D objects.","You may encounter an OBJ file in various ways, such as when modifying 3D objects in a video game, creating visual effects for a film, or designing a 3D mockup of a real-life object or building. Since the OBJ 3D format is so widely supported, many users export their models as OBJ files when transferring them from one 3D program to another or sharing a 3D model with a co-worker.","NOTE: While the OBJ format is one of the most common formats for storing 3D models, it is only one of many options for saving models. Some other options include .DAE , .STL , .IGS , .FBX , .MAX , .DWG , and .3DS ."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/obj_263.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .obj file in Microsoft 3D Builder","caption":"OBJ file open in Microsoft 3D Builder"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/obj_263-2.png","alt":"OBJ file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"OBJ file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"obj.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
