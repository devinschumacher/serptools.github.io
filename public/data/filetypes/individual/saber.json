If a player is dissatisfied with Beat Saber's default sabers, they can download and install custom sabers, saved as SABER files.","Modders create custom sabers in Beat Saber, using a plug-in such as Saber Factory 2, or in Open Saber VR. They then export the sabers as SABER files, so they and other players can import and select the sabers in-game.","NOTE: The Oculus Quest version of Beat Saber uses custom sabers saved as .ZIP or QSABER files. Only the PC version of Beat Saber uses SABER files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"saber.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
