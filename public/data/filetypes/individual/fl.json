One of the tools FLTK includes is FLUID, a visual GUI builder.","Developers use FLUID to create and edit GUIs using FLTK's included GUI widgets. FLUID projects are saved in FL files, which are comprised of FLTK source code. Typically, developers compile FL files into CXX and H files, using the command-line or in-app FLUID compiler, before including them in applications. However, an FL file can also be used to create a simple program, if all the program's code is contained in the FL file."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"fl.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
