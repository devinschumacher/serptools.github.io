Various Bethesda games contain ESM files, as do official expansion packs and unofficial plug-ins created and distributed by game modders. (Modders also use .ESP files to modify Elder Scrolls IV, Elder Scrolls V, and Fallout 4.)","You can find ESM files in the Data sub-directory of a game's parent directory (the directory in which the game's .EXE file is located). For example, Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion's primary ESM file, which is named Oblivion.esm , is located in the game's /​Oblivion/​Data folder.","NOTE: The .ESL file type is a \"lighter\" version of the ESM file type. It was introduced with the Fallout 4 patch 1.10 in August 2017 and is limited to 4096 records."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"esm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
