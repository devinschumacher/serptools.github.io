When you open an RTFD file using TextEdit, the file's attachments appear within it. You can double-click an attachment to open it in its associated app. For example, if you double-click an image, the image will open in Apple Preview.","If needed, you can view and open all the files contained within an RTFD bundle separately. In macOS, you can right-click an RTFD file and select Show Package Contents to view all the files contained within a bundle. In Windows File Explorer, you can open an RTFD bundle as you would any Windows folder, and then access the files contained within."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/rtfd_1174-2.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .rtfd file in Apple TextEdit","caption":"RTFD file open in Apple TextEdit"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"rtfd.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
