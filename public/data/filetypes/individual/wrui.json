The executables contained several viruses, one of which encrypted many of the users' files and renamed the files to use the .wrui extension.","WRUI ransomware is a variant of STOP ransomware, which is one of the most common types of ransomware. Other variants of STOP ransomware append users' files with the .STOP , .DJVU , .rumba , .gero , or .CADQ extensions.
