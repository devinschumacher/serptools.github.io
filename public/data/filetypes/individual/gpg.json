It allows you to encrypt and digitally sign files and email communications, using private cryptographic keys, and decrypt those files and communications using accompanying public keys.","Typically, files encrypted using GnuPG are saved with the .gpg extension. This denotes they were encrypted and can be decrypted with GnuPG. However, to decrypt a GPG file, you must possess the necessary GnuPG key (typically another user's public key).","NOTE: On occasion, some GPG files may instead contain a GnuPG key."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gpg.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
