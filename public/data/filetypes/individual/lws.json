When you create a scene with LightWave 3D, the app saves it in the default LWS format, which you can close and reopen for further editing.","The LWS format is similar to a CAD assembly file, such as an Autodesk Inventor Assembly ( .IAM ) or Parametric Pro/ENGINEER Assembly ( .ASM ) file. Like CAD Assembly files, LWS files may contain references to other files featured in the scene (LWO 3D Object files in the case of LWS files). If you move the location of referenced LWS files, the objects will not appear in the LWS scene when opened in LightWave 3D.","NOTE: NewTek initially developed LightWave 3D, but LightWave Digital acquired and currently develops the software."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/lws_2446.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .lws file in LightWave 3D 2020","caption":"LWS file open in LightWave 3D 2020"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/lws_2446-2.png","alt":"LWS file open in Apple TextEdit","caption":"LWS file open in Apple TextEdit"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"lws.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
