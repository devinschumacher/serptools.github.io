The virus can attack your computer in various ways, including email spam with infected attachments or malicious links or fraudulent software updates. Once the virus affects your computer it begins scrambling your files, renaming them with random characters, and encrypting them as XTBL files.","When encrypting your files, the .xtbl virus creates README.txt files that contain information about your encrypted files and instructions for decrypting them, which includes how to pay the criminals. These files are placed in each folder that contains XTBL files.","NOTE: XTBL files are similar to .CERBER , .CERBER2 , .LOCKY , and .ZZZZZ files which are all created by ransomware.
