It followed the Ensoniq EPS and Ensoniq EPS-16+ samplers and included a floppy drive.","Users could add sounds, presets, and songs to the sampler via floppy disks and share sounds with other users that they created with the ASR. While Ensoniq no longer produces the sampler, some music enthusiasts dump the data from the floppy disks and save them in the EDA format. Then, they play the EDA files or convert them to other file types with software."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"eda.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
