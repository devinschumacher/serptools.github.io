One of the ways users can adjust their screenshots is by using ShareX's After capture tasks → Add image effects tool to automatically apply pre-made effects.","Users create image effects by selecting Task settings → Image → Effects → Image effects configuration... from ShareX's menu bar. This launches the Image effects window, from which users can create and edit effects. When a user is done editing their effect, they can package the effect as an SXIE file, to share the effect with other ShareX users.","The Image effects window also contains an Image effects... button, which launches the Image Effects page of ShareX's website. From that page, users can download additional SXIE files, which they can import into ShareX."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/sxie_12171.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .sxie file in ShareX","caption":"SXIE file open in ShareX"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sxie.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
