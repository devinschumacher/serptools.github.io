The service originally only utilized .WEBP images for stickers but introduced the TGS format in July 2019 (version 5.9 of Telegram), which can store sticker animations at higher resolutions and smaller file sizes than the static WEBP stickers.","The TGS format is based on the Lottie library, which renders JSON-formatted data from Adobe After Effects animations. The format consists of a JSON text file exported from an animation in Adobe After Effects (with the Bodymovin-TG plugin) that is compressed with gzip compression as a .GZIP file. The text file stores information about the animation in JSON format, whereas the gzip compression reduces the size of the file.","TGS animated stickers cannot be larger than 64 KB or longer than 3 seconds and must be looped. Also, the sticker cannot go off of the canvas and the canvas size must be 512x512 pixels."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tgs.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
