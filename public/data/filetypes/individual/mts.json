The file format uses MPEG-4 / H.264 video compression and supports 720p and 1080i HD video resolutions. The audio in an MTS file may be compressed using the Dolby AC-3 codec or saved as uncompressed linear PCM audio. Supported audio tracks include stereo (2-channel) and 5.1 (5-channel + subwoofer) surround sound.","MTS videos are saved in the Advanced Video Coding High Definition format. The AVCHD format was established by Sony and Panasonic in 2006 and is used by many of the companies' HD camcorders. Most Sony and Panasonic HD camcorders come packaged with software that can open and edit MTS files.","NOTE: AVCHD files saved on a camcorder typically use the .mts file extension. AVCHD files edited on a computer or imported from a Blu-ray disc typically use the .M2TS extension."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/mts_1796.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .mts file in VideoLAN VLC media player 3","caption":"MTS file open in VideoLAN VLC media player 3"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/mts_2987.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .mts file in MadTracker 2","caption":"MTS file open in MadTracker 2"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mts.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
