When creating a backup, Smart Switch creates several encrypted files, each of which contains a portion of the user's phone data. Smart Switch then stores the encrypted files in a Smart Switch/â€‹Backup folder on the user's phone or PC.","One of the files a Smart Switch backup contains is an SNMM file. This file contains a copy of the notes a user has created in Samsung Notes. However, the file is saved in a proprietary, non-human-readable format. Therefore, you cannot simply open the file to read or retrieve your notes."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"SDOC.SMNN","description":"SDOC.SMNN - A Samsung Notes backup file created by Samsung Smart Switch."}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"snmm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
