This saves developers the time of writing and testing the function themselves. It also allows developers to create smaller apps (because they can reference SELF files instead of adding additional code to their app).","The PS3 and Vita include many SELF files. Updates sometimes install updated or new SELF files, which include updated or new functions that developers' apps and games might reference.","NOTE: .SPRX files are similar to SELF files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"self.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
