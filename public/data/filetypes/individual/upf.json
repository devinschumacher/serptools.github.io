When the device is at its highest point, the 36 cameras on the device capture 36 images, which are stored in the UPF file. The images are unstitched, but when viewed in the Panono Cloud are stitched together for a seamless 360-degree image. You can download UPF files from the Panono Cloud and stitch the individual images stored in a UPF file together with third party software or convert the images to .JPEG format with the Panono UPF Converter."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"upf.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
