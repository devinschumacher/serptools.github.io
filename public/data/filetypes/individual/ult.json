Musicians used Ultra Tracker to compose multi-channel music optimized for this hardware. Over time, other music trackers, such as MikMod, added support for the ULT format, allowing users to continue playing it despite the eventual discontinuation of the original software.","Later versions of Ultra Tracker introduced the .UNI format, which provided enhanced composition features and replaced ULT as the softwareâ€™s primary module format. While different versions of Ultra Tracker may save ULT files with slight variations, most modern module players that support the ULT format can play all versions."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/ult_1830.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .ult file in VideoLAN VLC media player","caption":"ULT file open in VideoLAN VLC media player"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ult.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
