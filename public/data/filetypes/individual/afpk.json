The utility allows users to load a set of audio files, create a database of that audio's landmarks, and then compare other audio files to that database, to see whether they are similar (and how they differ).","Audfprint can produce precomputed audio fingerprint files, saved in the AFPK format. Users can load these files into an audfprint database, just as they would any other audio file. Because AFPK files contain only a record of an audio file's peaks, and the format was developed at Columbia University, they are sometimes referred to as Columbia Peaks files.","NOTE: Each AFPK file begins with the string audfprintpeak , to identify it as an audfprint audio fingerprint."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"afpk.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
