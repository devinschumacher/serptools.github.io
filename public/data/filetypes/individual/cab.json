For example, a CAB file might contain driver updates for a printer. Windows often automatically downloads and installs the updates CAB files contain, using installers such as Setup API, Device Installer, and AdvPack. However, users can also manually download CAB files from the Microsoft Update Catalog.","Additionally, Windows users can create their own CAB files using a command-line utility called makecab . To use makecab , open a Command Prompt window, enter makecab.exe , and press Enter.
