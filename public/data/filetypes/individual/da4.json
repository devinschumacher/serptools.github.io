The story will change depending on what decisions you type. You will most likely encounter other living things in your game, these are considered creatures and will be \"friendly\" or \"hostile.\"","AGT games are often packaged with a number of files that contain game data, including .INS , .TTL , and .VOC files. Because of the large number of files that accompany the AGT game, the files can be converted into a single .AGX file with the AGT2AGX utility that comes with AGiliTy. This conversion reduces game size, load time, and clutter.","NOTE: DA4 files are similar to .DA3 , .DA5 , and .DA6 files. These files contain game data referenced for different aspects of the game."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"[name of the game].da4","description":"[name of the game].da4 - The DA4 file possesses the same name as the game it's created for."}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"da4.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
