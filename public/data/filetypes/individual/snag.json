After taking a screenshot with Snagit's capture tool, a user can add text, arrows, callouts, and other annotations to that screenshot using Snagit's image editor.","If a Snagit for Windows user wants to continue editing an annotated screenshot in the future, they can save that screenshot as a SNAG file. Users can also save annotated screenshots as .JPG , .PNG , .GIF , .BMP , .PDF , or .TIF files, but those formats do not preserve annotations as editable objects.","NOTE: Prior to Snagit 2022, the Mac version of Snagit saved editable captures as .SNAGPROJ files. In Snagit 2022 and later versions, both platforms' versions of Snagit began saving editable captures as .SNAGX files."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/snag_5345.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .snag file in Snagit 2022","caption":"SNAG file open in Snagit 2022"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"snag.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
