This format became one of the primary formats that Russian agencies use to exchange geographic data, such as topographic and navigational maps, with each other.","Each SXF file contains one or more position-based objects organized into layers. Objects may include points, lines, polygons, signatures, and graphics. When opened in a GIS or mapping application, the objects an SXF file describes are overlaid on an associated map.","NOTE: SXF files are sometimes paired with RSC files that use the same filename. An RSC file defines its corresponding SXF file's object name and formatting information."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sxf.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
