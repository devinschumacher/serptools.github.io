While MED used only MED files to store sounds, OctaMED used both MED and .8MED files to do the same.","OctaMED was notable for being able to play eight-channel audio on the Commodore Amiga's four-channel sound chip. While OctaMED was ported to Windows in the late 1990s (under the name MED Soundstudio), it is no longer developed or maintained."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"med.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
