Before the STEP format's existence, users of one program often could not open models created in another program, making it difficult to share 3D models among users.","Most STEP files are saved with the .stp file extension. However, you may also encounter STEP models saved with the .step extension ( .STEP files). The files contain plain text data that a CAD or CAM program references to load a 3D model. For example, many STP files contain data used to show a model of a manufactured mold or part."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/stp_2374.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .stp file in Autodesk Fusion 360 2.0","caption":"STP file open in Autodesk Fusion 360 2.0"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/stp_2374-2.png","alt":"STP file open in Microsoft Notepad","caption":"STP file open in Microsoft Notepad"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"stp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
