For example, co-workers conducting a team chat in Microsoft Teams can post and vote on a poll, or they can paste in a piece of text and edit it together in real-time.","When a user creates a new Loop component within a Microsoft 365 app, Loop saves that component as a LOOP file. Each user's LOOP files are stored in their Microsoft OneDrive for Business storage, so the user can quickly access and open them at any time.","NOTE: In the past, LOOP files were saved as .FLUID files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"loop.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
