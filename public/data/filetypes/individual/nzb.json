You can also post binary files to newsgroups to share media and other non-text content with other Usenet users.","Newzbin.com developed the NZB file format to allow the service to index binary newsgroup posts. NZB files contain a record of the metadata needed to download a post. If a user possesses a post's NZB file, they can import that file into their Usenet client and use it to download the post.","Posts may be split into several UseNet messages or segments. In those cases, the segments and the order in which they should be assembled post-download are defined in the post's NZB file. Usenet clients automatically assemble downloaded files that are split into multiple segments."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/nzb_1595.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .nzb file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"NZB file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"nzb.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
