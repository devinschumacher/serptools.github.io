The system uses its own programming language, also called SageMath, which is Python-like but includes support for specialized mathematical operations.","Developers creating SageMath programs save those programs' source code in SAGE files. After a developer finishes developing their program, they can execute it by using SageMath's load command to load their SAGE file.","NOTE: SageMath has previously been known as Sage and SAGE. Sage stands for System for Algebra and Geometry Experimentation."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/sage_12949.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .sage file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"SAGE file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sage.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
