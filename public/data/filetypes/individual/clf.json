To import images into Caesium, users select File → Add Pictures... or File → Open Folder... and then select the images they want to import. The imported images then appear in Caesium's file list.","If a user wants to save their current Caesium file list, so they can easily load and manipulate the same set of images in the future, they can select File → Save List from Caesium's menu bar. Caesium will then save the user's current file list in a CLF file.","CLF files are plain text files, which list the same attributes Caesium show in its file list. Most often, CLF files will specify each image's name, file size, resolution, and location. If you have already compressed or resized an image included in your file list, your CLF file will also contain information about the compressed or resized version of your image, such as its new file size and resolution."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/clf_12349.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .clf file in SaeraSoft Caesium","caption":"CLF file open in SaeraSoft Caesium"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"clf.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
