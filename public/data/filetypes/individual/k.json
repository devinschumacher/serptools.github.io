The framework includes its own programming language, referred to as K.","Developers working with the K Framework write programs using the K language and save those programs' source code as K files. Typically, each K file includes one or more modules, which define a program's function(s). Each module's name consists of one or more groups of letters, numbers, or underscores, separated by hyphens. Primarily, modules consist of syntax and rules. Modules can also import other modules, saved in other K files.","After a developer finishes creating their K file(s), they can use kompile to compile the files. They can then use krun to run the program their K file(s) contain."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/k_12915.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .k file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"K file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"k.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
