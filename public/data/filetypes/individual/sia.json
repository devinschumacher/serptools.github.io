Users, or \"renters,\" can purchase contracts with other users, or \"hosts,\" for storage space on the Sia blockchain using Siacoin, a cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin.","The renters then upload their files through Sia and the files are divided into 30 different segments. This method helps protects against data loss due to cyberattacks or downed servers by spreading the storage across different spaces. 10 of the 30 segments are required for Sia renters to retrieve stored data. The SIA file is used by Sia to verify that the user has permission to access the uploaded files.","NOTE: The first version of the SIA file format was released in May 2015 with multiple versions subsequently released."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sia.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
