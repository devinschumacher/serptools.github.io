Typically, these PLIST files are XML files, which store a list of Keys (setting names) and Values (settings).","As a developer finalizes their application for delivery to end users, they often convert some or all of their PLIST files to a binary format. For example, developers often convert PLIST files that track a user's preferences to binary. Thus, PLIST files packaged with or installed by an app may be plain text files or binary files.","NOTE: Some Apple applications for Windows, such as iTunes and Safari, also use PLIST files. Additionally, in some rare cases, PLIST files may use JSON formatting."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"Info.plist","description":"Info.plist - The primary property list for macOS applications, located in the /​Contents/​ directory of an .APP bundle.
