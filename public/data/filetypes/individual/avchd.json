As a format, AVCHD favors comparably to .HDV and is a format which is acceptable for professional use.","Playback of the AVCHD format is not supported across all Blu-ray Disc players as even though AVCHD does share many format similarities with Blu-ray Disc, it is not part of the Blu-ray Disc specification.","NOTE: There is a known incompatibility of the AVCHD format within the Panasonic brand's original HD Writer importing and editing software, which shipped from 2006 to 2008. This version of HD Writer cannot recognize the current 1080i format or newer formats like 1080p50 or 1080p60. The newer HD Writer AE can in fact read the newer 1080i format while versions 2 and higher can read 1080p (in both frame rates)."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"avchd.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
