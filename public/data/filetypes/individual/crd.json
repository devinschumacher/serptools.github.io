The tool could write lead sheets, which are songs with lyrics and chords, and it would save the lead sheets as CRD files.","Leclerc and Dorion eventually stopped developing the chord tool, and Johan Vromans replaced it with ChordPro in 2016. With the new app, the ChordPro format and .cho file replaced the chord format and .crd file. However, ChordPro still supports the chord format, but it is now considered a legacy format.","NOTE: While the crd format typically uses CRD files, it may also use the .chord , .chopro , and .pro file extensions."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/crd_1059.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .crd file in Apple TextEdit 1","caption":"CRD file open in Apple TextEdit 1"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"crd.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
