AAXC files contain an additional layer of encryption, to prevent users from converting the files to .MP3 files and playing them in non-Audible media players.","None of the free tools that allow users to convert AAX files to MP3 files work on AAXC files. However, Audible users can still download any of their audiobooks as AAX files in the Audible desktop app, and then convert those files to MP3 files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"aaxc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
