In 1990, the ITU introduced the G.726 codec. This codec replaced both the G.721 and G.723 codecs, which were previous ITU standards.","The G.726 codec is used primarily to encode audio transmitted over international and wireless phone networks. On occasion, raw G.726 audio is saved in G726 files. These files are uncommon, so most media players cannot play them. However, some audio libraries allow users to play the audio G726 files contain and convert them to more usable formats."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"g726.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
