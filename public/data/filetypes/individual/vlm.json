To date, Vimm's Lair hosts over 1,000 video game manuals for games played on over 20 video game consoles. The majority of the manuals Vimm's Lair hosts are for older games, such as those from the Atari 2600, Super Nintendo, and original PlayStation consoles.","Those who browse Vimm's Lairs manual collection have the choice of downloading manuals as .PDF or VLM files. According to the website, VLM files appear slightly crisper than their PDF equivalents. However, VLM files can be opened only in the Vimm's Lair Manual Viewer application, while PDFs can be opened in most web browsers and any PDF reader."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vlm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
