They replaced .ZED files, which are used by versions 1 - 6 of the software.","UZED files are similar to ZED files but instead of storing only a Zip-compressed GEDCOM file, it also includes a metadata.xml file that stores metadata about the family tree. Also, the GEDCOM file compressed in the UZED archive stores Unicode UTF-8-encoded text instead of ANSI-encoded text, which the GEDCOM file in the ZED archive utilizes.","ZED and UZED files are often referred to as being saved in the ZEDCOM (Zipped-GEDCOM) format. The files were replaced by .FTB SQLite database files with the release of version 8 of MyHeritage Family Tree Builder."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"uzed.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
