Voyeur was originally released in 1993 in the Compact Disc-Interactive (CD-i) format, which is an optical disc data storage format supported by CD-i players, such as Philips CD-i. The game was then released a year later in 1994 for MS-DOS and Macintosh computers."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"rl2.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
