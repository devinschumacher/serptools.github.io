Developers who are creating iOS applications can create and link multiple UI scenes together in a single STORYBOARD file. This allows them and other developers to view the app's workflows.","To create a STORYBOARD file, developers select Storyboard in the User Interface: field while creating an iOS app project. Xcode then creates a main.storyboard file. Developers can also manually add a STORYBOARD to their iOS projects at any time by selecting File → New → New File... from Xcode's menu and choosing to create an iOS Storyboard file."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"storyboard.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
