The story will change depending on what decisions you type.","AGT games are often packaged with a number of files that contain game data, including .VOC , .TTL , and .INS files. Because of the large number of files that accompany the AGT game, the files can be converted into a single .AGX file with the AGT2AGX utility that comes with AGiliTy. This conversion helps reduce game size and load time.","NOTE: DA6 files are similar to .DA3 , .DA4 , and .DA5 files, which contain game data referenced for different aspects of the game."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"[name of the game].da6","description":"[name of the game].da6 - The DA6 bears the same name as the game it's created for."}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"da6.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
