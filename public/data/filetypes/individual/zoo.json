Zoo was available for Unix-based operating systems, MS-DOS, and AmigaOS.","Notably, ZOO archives can contain multiple versions of the same file, if each version was modified on a different date. This allows zoo users to save and retrieve prior versions of a file from a ZOO archive, to revert to a previous version or compare an old version to a more recent version."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"zoo.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
