This format, known as VRM, provides specifications users can use to create humanoid character avatars.","Typically, users use Unity and the UniVRM Unity asset package to create VRM files. Users can also use VRoid Studio to create VRM files. Then, they can load the VRM file in various VR programs that support the VRM avatar standard. For example, you can load a VRM file in VSeeFace, an avatar puppeteering program, to use the avatar it contains in an animated YouTube video."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/vrm_12697.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .vrm file in VSeeFace","caption":"VRM file open in VSeeFace"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vrm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
