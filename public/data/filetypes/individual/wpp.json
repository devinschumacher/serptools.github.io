The application supported manual coding, but it was primarily developed to make website design easier for novices by allowing them to drag and drop elements, such as buttons, graphics, and forms, onto their website design.","The WPP file is the primary file type associated with WebPlus because it stores all the information about a project when you save a website project. You can save a project, close it, then re-open it to edit it further.","WPP files are not meant to be uploaded as a website. Instead, you can publish the site as the appropriate .HTML and .CSS files with WebPlus when you are done modifying it."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"wpp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
