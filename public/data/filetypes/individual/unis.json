It allows gamers to create and play their own Super Mario levels, as well as share levels with others.","When a creator saves a UniMaker level, that level is saved as a UNIS file. UniMaker includes several example UNIS files that users can load, edit, and play to learn how UniMaker works, and UniMaker's website contains links to download additional UNIS files, created by other UniMaker users.","Each UNIS file contains hexadecimal data that is used to show a level in UniMaker. The file's header shows what version of UniMaker created the file.","In the UniMaker level editor, you can save a level as a UNIS file by clicking the Robot icon and then clicking the Upload icon. The Save Course window will then appear."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/unis_12061.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .unis file in UniMaker 1.2","caption":"UNIS file open in UniMaker 1.2"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"unis.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
