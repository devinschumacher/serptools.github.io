While Trimble now owns SketchUp, Google and @Last Software previously developed it. @Last Software released all versions of SketchUp up to version 5, and Google released version 6.","The SKP format is the default format SketchUp uses to save complete 3D models, such as building designs or video game characters. However, SKP files may also contain SketchUp components, such as a door, window, or beam, instead of a complete building. Storing these components in SKP files allows designers to import and reuse them in multiple designs easily.","NOTE: The Windows version of SketchUp automatically creates backups of users' SKP files ( .SKB files). If you delete an SKP file or it becomes corrupted, you can restore the file using its SKB equivalent. The macOS version of SketchUp automatically saves SKP backups with the filename filename~.skp ."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/skp_2059.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .skp file in Trimble SketchUp 2022","caption":"SKP file open in Trimble SketchUp 2022"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"skp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
