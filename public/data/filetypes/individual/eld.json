To simulate a light source, designers import an Elumudat-format data file that describes the light source's characteristics and behavior. Lighting installation manufacturers often create these data files and provide them to lighting designers, for use in DIALux.","On rare occasions, Elumudat data files may be saved with the .eld extension. More commonly, these files are saved with the .LDT extension. Most programs that use Elumudat-format files do not recognize the .eld extension. Therefore, you should likely rename your ELD file to use the .ldt extension, so you can open it more easily."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/eld_9333.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .eld file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"ELD file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"eld.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
