The game allows players to use various unofficial add-ons and mods to enhance their gameplay. The Litematica includes most of the features available with the old Schematica and also provides some new capabilities.","Litematica's main capability is that it can display a schematic of an area with information on how to build it (e.g., where to place the blocks) and highlights missing, extra, or wrongly placed blocks. When you create a schematic of a selected area with Litematica, the mod saves it as a LITEMATIC file."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"litematic.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
