It was commonly used in Windows applications, such as Microsoft Word, Publisher, and PowerPoint, but was replaced by the .EMF (Enhanced Windows Metafile) format in 1992.","To make sharing WMF images easier, some programs compressed the images using Gzip compression, transforming them into WMZ files. As the WMF format declined in use and popularity, so did the WMZ format."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"wmz.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
