It has various tools for creating, mixing, designing, and restoring audio with an advanced toolset. For example, one of the tools is the ability to reduce background and broadband noise on a track.","To apply the noise reduction effect:","In the \"Effect - Noise Reduction\" window, you can choose Capture Noise Print , which saves a noise profile from the selected range so Audition can remove similar noise from the rest of the waveform. You can also save the noise print as an FFT file. To save a selected noise print as an FFT file, click the Save the current noise print option (save-to-disk icon) next to the Capture Noise Print option."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/fft_6816.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .fft file in Adobe Audition 2023","caption":"FFT file open in Adobe Audition 2023"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"fft.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
