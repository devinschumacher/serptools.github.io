When you load the game, you can enable \"/recorddemo 1\" before playing a match or deathmatch so the game records it to a DMO file.","After the match, game clients can download the DMO file from the host server that recorded it. Once downloaded, the game can play the files in local mode, allowing you to view the demo from any angle in the game.","NOTE: DMO files do not contain video data. If you would like to record a video session, choose an alternate recording function (e.g., Cube 2: Sauerbraten's movie recording functionality allows you to record a match as an .AVI file)."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"dmo.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
