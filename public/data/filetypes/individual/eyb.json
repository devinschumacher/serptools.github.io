Prior to Encarta 2000, users could download monthly Encarta content updates, called Yearbook Updates, from the internet. Primarily, users downloaded updates from within Encarta's Yearbook Builder or from The Microsoft Network (MSN).","After downloading an EYB file, Encarta users installed it via the Yearbook Builder. Doing so integrated the content the EYB file contained with the user's version of Encarta. After integrating an EYB file with Encarta, the Yearbook Builder deleted the EYB file and replaced it with a .YBK file (which contains the EYB file's contents saved in a different format)."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"eyb.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
