Referencing DLL files saves programmers time (since they don't need to manually code common functions) and reduces their programs' file sizes (since the programs don't need to contain the resources stored in the DLL file).","When a program needs to use the data stored in a DLL file, it dynamically loads that DLL file into system memory . The program can then access and use the functions (and other data) the DLL file includes as though it were a part of the program.","Third-party programs may install additional DLL files on your computer. These DLL files function the same way as Windows' default DLL files, but are likely shared among only programs created by that developer.","If a program requires a DLL file that you do not have, it will likely show a \"missing DLL\" or \"DLL not found\" error message. In these instances, there are several actions you can take to attempt to resolve the DLL error, including:","In most cases, you should not attempt to manually find and download the DLL file you are missing from the internet. DLL files hosted on non-Microsoft DLL download sites may be vehicles for malware ."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"user32.dll","description":"user32.dll - Contains instructions for graphical elements such as dialog boxes and windows."},{"filename":"shell32.dll","description":"shell32.dll - Contains Windows shell API functions."},{"filename":"msvcrt.dll","description":"msvcrt.dll - Contains standard C library functions.
