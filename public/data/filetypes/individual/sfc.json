These days, though, most SFC files are stored on and downloaded from emulator-related websites, which provide retro gamers with the ability to play Super Famicom games on their PCs.","Because they were created from Japanese or South Korean game cartridges, SFC files typically contain the Japanese or Korean version of a game. However, the SFC file format is virtually identical to the .SMC file format, which was used for English language Super Nintendo games. Thus, most SNES emulators that can open SMC files can also open SFC files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sfc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
