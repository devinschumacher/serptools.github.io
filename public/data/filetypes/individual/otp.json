Impress's OTP files are similar to PowerPoint's .POT and .POTX templates.","The OTP format is based on the OASIS OpenDocument standard, which uses an XML format to save presentations. Various presentation programs can create OTP files, but most are created by Impress.","You will likely encounter an OTP file only if you use Impress or another OpenOffice user shares a presentation template with you. For example, a co-worker who uses Impress might share an OTP file that contains a branded presentation template with you.","NOTE: The Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) maintains the OpenDocument standard."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/otp_722.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .otp file in Apache OpenOffice Impress 4","caption":"OTP file open in Apache OpenOffice Impress 4"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"otp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
