{"slug":"vmcz","extension":"vmcz","name":"Hyper-V Compressed Virtual Machine","category":"hyper-v-compressed-virtual-machine","summary":"","developer_org":"microsoft","developer_name":"Microsoft","more_information":{"description":["Microsoft Hyper-V allows users to run multiple operating systems as virtual machines in Windows, as well as create and manage virtualized software and hardware components. Hyper-V software also comes with Hyper-V Manager, which is a tool that provides a friendly user interface (UI) for interacting with Hyper-V. Hyper-V Manager is available as an optional program built into Windows systems that support Hyper-V.","Microsoft introduced the VMCZ file type when it added the virtual machine export capability to Hyper-V Manager with the release of the Windows 10 Insider Build of 16226 in June 2017. The feature was introduced through the addition of a \"Share\" button to the UI of Hyper-V Manager that allows users to export a Hyper-V VM as a compressed VMCZ file.","The Share feature makes it easier for users to copy virtual machines and transport them to other locations. After moving a VMCZ file to another system with Hyper-V installed, a user can simply double-click the file to import it into Hyper-V.","Since a VMCZ file is a Zip-compressed package, a user can also manually extract the contents of the package with a Zip-decompression utility, such as Microsoft File Explorer, Corel WinZip, 7-Zip, or WinRAR. The contents typically include a VM hard disk drive .VHD or .VHDX file, a VM configuration .VMCX file, and a VM run state VMRS file.","To export a virtual machine in Hyper-V Manager as a VMCZ file, select the \"Share\" button in the toolbar or right-click a virtual machine, then select Export .","NOTE: Hyper-V was first released with Windows Server 2008 and has been made available for free beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. It is available in 64-bit versions of Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vmcz.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
