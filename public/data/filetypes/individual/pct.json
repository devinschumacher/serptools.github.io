Two versions of the PICT format, PICT 1 and PICT 2, exist. PICT 1 supports up to eight colors. PICT 2 supports 24- and 32-bit color (up to millions of colors).","While the PICT format is a vector format, PICT files can contain embedded raster images. Many PICT files contain only a single embedded raster image and do not contain any vector data.","NOTE: PICT images that use the .pct extension were likely created on a Windows computer. PICT images created on Macs typically use the .PICT extension."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/pct_73.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .pct file in Adobe Photoshop","caption":"PCT file open in Adobe Photoshop"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pct.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
