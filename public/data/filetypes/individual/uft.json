These font files contain bitmap graphics of each of the character glyphs used in the game text. Because of this pre-caching, the engine can quickly load the pre-rendered bitmap characters as graphical text in the game."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"uft.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
