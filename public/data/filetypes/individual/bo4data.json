{"slug":"bo4data","extension":"bo4data","name":"OpenTerrainGenerator Binary Custom Structure","category":"openterraingenerator-binary-custom-structure","summary":"","developer_org":"pg85","developer_name":"PG85","more_information":{"description":["Minecraft Java Edition players can install the OpenTerrainGenerator plug-in and use it to create and load custom Minecraft worlds. Each OpenTerrainGenerator world is generated using one or more biome configuration ( .BC ) files. In turn, each biome configuration file references a set of BO4 files, which contain information about custom structures that appear in the biome.","To make their custom worlds load more quickly, OpenTerrainGenerator users can convert their plain text BO4 files into binary BO4DATA files. OpenTerrainGenerator loads BO4DATA files more quickly than BO4 files, which speeds up worlds' load times.","To convert BO4 files to BO4DATA files, users enter the /otg exportbo4data command in-game. This transforms any BO4 files stored in the current world's WorldObjects directory into BO4DATA files. After converting a world's BO4 files to BO4DATA files, the user should remove the world's BO4 files from the WorldObjects directory."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"bo4data.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
