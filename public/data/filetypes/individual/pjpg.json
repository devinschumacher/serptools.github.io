PJPEG differs from the standard Baseline JPEG format, which stores a complete, top-to-bottom scan of the image (the final scan in the PJPEG format).","For example, when browsing the web with a slow internet connection, you could possibly wait 30 seconds for an image on a webpage saved in the Baseline JPEG format to load line by line in a blank space on the page. However, a web browser loading an image saved in the PJPEG format loads scans of the image that progressively increase in quality with each pass, allowing you to quickly see a low-resolution version of the image (likely blurry and pixelated) that improves (becomes sharper and less pixelated) as the browser loads progressive PJPEG image scans.","Progressive JPEG save dialog in Adobe Photoshop 2023 Various image editors allow you to save JPEG images in the Progressive JPEG format.
