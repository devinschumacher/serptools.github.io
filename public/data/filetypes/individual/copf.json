This allows users to complete otherwise-arduous file copying tasks quickly.","If a user expects to perform the same file copying operation multiple times, or they want to create a file copying template they can load and alter in the future, they can save a list of the files they are copying and folders they are copying to in a COPF file. COPF files are saved in plain text format so, in addition to being able to use them in Copy Files Into Multiple Folders, you can open and examine them in any text editor."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/copf_11878.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .copf file in Copy Files Into Multiple Folders","caption":"COPF file open in Copy Files Into Multiple Folders"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"copf.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
