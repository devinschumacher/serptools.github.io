The format is only used by version 6 and later of ARTlink.","Older versions of ARTlink save designs as ART files, by default. But beginning with version 5 of ARTlink, the software saves designs with file extensions that reflect the version of the software. For example, ARTlink 5 saves designs as .ART50 files, and ARTlink 7 saves designs as .ART70 files.","After converting the design, insert a USB storage device in your computer, then transfer the converted design file to the connected storage device via File Explorer in Windows or Finder in macOS. You can also transfer the file to a connected storage device directly from within ARTlink by selecting File â†’ Write to Card/Machine... .","After transferring the file, eject the storage device from your computer and insert it into the sewing machine. Then, transfer the design to the machine and embroider it onto the material."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/art60_11984.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .art60 file in BERNINA ARTlink 8","caption":"ART60 file open in BERNINA ARTlink 8"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"art60.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
