The format is often used by CAD applications to save 3D models of real-life objects or buildings for the purpose of being manufactured and constructed.","Various CAD file types utilize the BRep format, such as CATIA .CATPART and .CATPRODUCT , .IGS and .IGES , .STEP , and Parasolid .X_B and .X_T . While the BRep format is common in the CAD community, actual BREP files are uncommon."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"brep.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
