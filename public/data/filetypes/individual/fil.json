It allows users to, among other things, identify trends and exceptions among data, track compliance with organizational or governmental standards, and perform automated analytic testing.","Data analysts using ACL create one or more projects to import, analyze, and report on data. These project files contain many constituent files, including FIL files. Each FIL file contains the data associated with a specific database table. FIL files do not, however, contain table layout information, which ACL uses to show data to users. Therefore, you must either import an associated table layout file before you import a FIL file into ACL, or you must create a new table layout as you import your FIL file."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"fil.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
