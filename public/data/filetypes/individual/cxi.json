Before they can load games into an emulator, players must either create emulator-compatible game files themselves, by \"dumping\" data from their game cartridges into packaged game files, or download pre-packaged game files from the Internet. Game files packaged for 3DS emulators can be saved using a number of file formats and extensions, including .3ds , .CIA , and .cxi .","Notably, the programs Braindump and GodMode9 allow 3DS players to create CXI files from games installed on their Nintendo 3DS. Players then use these files to play 3DS games using the Lime3DS (replaced Citra) Nintendo 3DS emulator.","NOTE: While either 3DS or CXI files can be used to play games in Lime3DS, the files' contents are not the same. Most importantly, some 3DS files may contain multiple CXI files, only one of which is used to install and play a game. The others contain non-essential game data, such as the game's manual and updates."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"cxi.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
