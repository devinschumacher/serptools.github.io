Before a developer can use the NekoVM, they must install Neko on their computer.","The Neko installation includes several NDLL files. These are Neko's standard code libraries. In Windows, NDLL files are typically stored in the C:/​neko directory. In macOS and Linux, NDLL files are typically stored in the /​usr/​local/​lib/​neko directory.","Neko programs, saved in .NEKO files, reference and use the functions saved in NDLL files. If a Neko program cannot find the NDLL files it needs to run, that program may not run correctly."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ndll.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
