In Windows Live Movie Maker, you can export WLMP projects to .WMV files, publish them to YouTube, and burn them to DVDs.","Windows Live Movie Maker was initially released in 2000 as part of the Windows Essentials software suite. It is primarily used to create and edit videos then share them to YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, Flickr, or OneDrive.","However, in 2012, Microsoft discontinued the Windows Live name and the program became known as just Windows Movie Maker. Microsoft then discontinued Windows Movie Maker replacing it with the Photos app that comes with Windows 10. The app includes the ability to create and edit videos with music, text, and 3D effects. The Photos app does not support the WLMP file format."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"wlmp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
