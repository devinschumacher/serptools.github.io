Users can use the Prism's accompanying control software to create an RGB profile that controls how the LEDs behave.","If a user wants to export their cooler's RGB profile, they can do so by saving the profile as an SR4 file. Users can then transfer their SR4 file to another computer that uses a Wraith Prism, to use the same lighting effect across multiple fans. Wraith Prism users also sometimes share their SR4 files online, to allow others to use their lighting effects."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/sr4_12185.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .sr4 file in Microsoft Notepad 2004","caption":"SR4 file open in Microsoft Notepad 2004"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sr4.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
