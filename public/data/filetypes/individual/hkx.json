The engine uses a variety of files to simulate physics, including HKX files. HKX files store character animations, skeletons, and behaviors that are referenced and applied when a character performs an action or collides with another in-game object.","Most gamers will never encounter HKX files, but Skyrim and Fallout 4 players who enjoy modding games sometimes convert, open, and edit HKX files to modify characters' in-game behavior."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"hkx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
