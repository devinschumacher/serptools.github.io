For example, if you download a password-protected RAR file from the internet, but you do not know the file's password, you can use ARPR to retrieve the file's password from within the file itself.","By default, ARPR automatically saves each password recovery project's progress to an ARR file every five minutes. ARPR stores these auto-save files in its installation directory. If a user is forced to cancel an in-progress password recovery process, they can load that process's ARR file to resume it from its last saved state.","Advanced users can change ARPR's auto-save settings, using the options found on the program's Auto-save tab. This allows users to customize their ARR files' filenames, specify how often ARPR creates and overwrites ARR files, and change where ARPR saves ARR files.","NOTE: Elcomsoft has replaced Advanced RAR Password Recovery with Advanced Archive Password Recovery, which uses .AXR files in place of ARR files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"arr.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
