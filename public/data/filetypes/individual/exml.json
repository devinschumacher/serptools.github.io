Enterprising No Man's Sky modders have created programs that allow them to extract, convert, and edit these files. One such program is NMS Modding Station.","NMS Modding Station converts many of No Man Sky's PAK files into .MBIN files. These are binary files that contain No Man Sky's general gameplay settings, as well as settings used to generate items and determine how in-game objects behave. To edit these settings, modders must first convert the binary MBIN files into plain text EXML files. Then, modders can edit No Man's Sky's settings using any text editor.","After editing EXML files, modders convert the files back into PAK files and repack them in No Man's Sky, to apply their edits to the game's settings."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"exml.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
