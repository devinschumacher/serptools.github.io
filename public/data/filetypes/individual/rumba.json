{"slug":"rumba","extension":"rumba","name":"RUMBA Ransomware Encrypted File","category":"rumba-ransomware-encrypted-file","summary":"","developer_org":"n-a","developer_name":"N/A","more_information":{"description":["Ransomware is a category of malicious programs that encrypt or otherwise prevent a user from accessing files before producing a ransom note. The ransom note details how the user can pay to unlock their files. STOP ransomware, which encrypts a user's files and then produces a plain text ransom note named _readme.txt , is one of the most common types of ransomware.","In January 2019, some PC users reported their computers had been infected by a new variant of STOP, which appended encrypted files with the .rumba extension. The RUMBA variant of STOP encrypts users' files using an offline encryption key, which means users can likely decrypt the files themselves using the Emsisoft Decryptor for STOP Djvu (linked below).","RUMBA ransomware is most commonly distributed in programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed an unverified program, that may be how RUMBA ransomware infected your computer.","NOTE: To learn more about STOP ransomware and its variants, refer to the .STOP entry."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"rumba.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
