When a developer does this, the asset is transformed from a single UASSET file into a set of three files: a UASSET file, a UEXP file, and a UBULK file. These files are often saved in a PAK archive.","The UEXP file contains the data used to load and show the asset in-game. The UASSET file contains the asset's file header, and the UBULK file contains the asset's bulk data."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"uexp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
