You most likely will never see a TAX15 file since TurboTax saves tax returns as TAX2015 files by default. However, if you do come across the TAX15 file you can open it with the 2015 and 2016 desktop versions of TurboTax, which is available for both Windows and Mac. After the TAX15 file is opened you can then save the tax return as a TAX2015 file.","You can electronically submit TAX15 files to the IRS and state tax authorities. The \"e-file\" process is free for federal returns, but most likely requires a fee to file state returns electronically. You can also print and mail TAX16 files if you do not want to file them electronically."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tax15.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
