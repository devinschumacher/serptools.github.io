You can add parents, children, and spouses to a tree by tapping and creating a new entry in that tree. When you add a person to a family tree, you can record that person's name, birthdate, death date, and gender. You can also add a photograph of that person. Trees are displayed as a set of photographs and/or icons linked together, with each family member's name appearing under their photo or icon.","If you want to export a family tree from Quick Family Tree, you can do so by opening the app's Data manager and selecting the Export icon.
