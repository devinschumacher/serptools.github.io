The files are often downloaded from a World of Tanks community site then placed in the \"mods\" folder of the game installation directory in order to take effect in the game.","Since the files are simply renamed .ZIP files, users can extract the contents in WOTMOD files using Zip decompression programs, such as 7-Zip, WinRAR, or Apple Archive Utility. To do this, rename the \".wotmod\" extension to \".zip\" and decompress the archive."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"wotmod.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
