It allows users to import videos, images, and audio files, edit and combine those files into a single video, add effects to their video projects, and publish videos directly to social media apps.","When a user saves an in-progress Luxea video-editing project, the project is saved as an ALPX file. While ALPX files are used to open video-editing projects, they do not actually contain any video, image, or audio files. Instead, ALPX files contain text-based references to the media files included in a Luxea project, including the locations at which those files are stored. If you move a file referenced in an ALPX file, your video project will not load correctly in Luxea.","ALPX files also contain a record of a video project's properties, length, tracks, effects, and edits. This list is used to load the project, its associated settings, and its associated edits in Luxea."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/alpx_12091.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .alpx file in ACDSee Luxea 5.1","caption":"ALPX file open in ACDSee Luxea 5.1"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"alpx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
