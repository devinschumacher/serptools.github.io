When you create and save a design project, the STUDIO3 file is the default format used to store the design. However, you can also choose to save the design as a .STUDIO or .GSP file. The STUDIO3 file replaced the STUDIO file with the release of version 3. The STUDIO file was used by versions 1 and 2 of Silhouette Studio.","Once you are finished with your design you can verify the cutting, emboss, deboss, grid, registration marks, stipple, and cut settings. You can then send it to a connected Silhouette device for cutting."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/studio3_10433.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .studio3 file in Silhouette Studio 3","caption":"STUDIO3 file open in Silhouette Studio 3"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"studio3.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
