They may also encrypt the ZPAQ archive to secure sensitive information, such as financial documents or personal photos.","Matt Mahoney released the first version of the ZPAQ algorithm in 2009 to improve upon other common compression formats, such as .ZIP , .7Z , and .RAR . He followed the initial version with subsequent releases that improved its capabilities, including the ability to choose between Streaming and Journaling methods. In addition, the ZPAQ format is backward and forward compatible, meaning that utilities that support ZPAQ support all versions of the ZPAQ format."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/zpaq_12906.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .zpaq file in ConeXware PowerArchiver 2022","caption":"ZPAQ file open in ConeXware PowerArchiver 2022"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"zpaq.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
