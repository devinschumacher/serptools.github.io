The data feed integration allows users to access current data without the need to manually enter the data.","The data is fed from SQL Server to a report in order to populate the different regions of the report, such as tables, lists, charts, graphs, matrices, and gauges. Each region of a report has its own data feed, but some regions may have multiple data feeds depending on their structure. These data feeds are stored in the ATOMSVC file.","It is important to note that the ATOMSVC files do not store the actual data seen in each region. They store information for connecting to one or more data feeds, which may be the URL address of the web server or the address of a local or shared folder on a computer that points to the location of the data.","To create an ATOMSVC file, select the \"Export to Data Feed\" icon next to a report in the \"Reporting Services\" web portal and save the document.","To open the ATOMSVC file in Power Pivot in Excel:","NOTE: Since ATOMSVC files are saved in XML format, they can also be opened by an XML editor or text editor."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"atomsvc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
