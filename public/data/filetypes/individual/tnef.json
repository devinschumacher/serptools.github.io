Most often, TNEF files contain information that Microsoft Outlook uses to format a rich text format email message. This information might define embedded documents, forms, voting buttons, or meeting requests that the message includes. Other TNEF files contain email attachments, such as documents or images.","When an email client that does not support the TNEF format receives a message that includes a TNEF file, it may show that file as a message attachment. It may append the text application/ms-tnef to the start of the message. While some of the TNEF files these email clients create use the .tnef file extension, they are more commonly named Winmail.dat .","NOTE: You can learn more about Winmail.dat files here ."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tnef.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
