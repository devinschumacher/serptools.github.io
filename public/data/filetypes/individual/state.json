RetroArch is one such emulator. When a gamer wants to save their progress while playing a game in RetroArch, they do so by creating a save state. A save state is a snapshot of a gamer's current game state, and it is saved in a STATE file. Most often, gamers create STATE files when they are about to quit an in-progress game, so they can resume the game at a later time.","Notably, RetroArch users can save different game states to different state slots within the same STATE file. This allows players to create multiple game saves and resume their progress from different points within a game. Players can select different state slots when saving or loading game states from RetroArch's quick menu.","While all video game emulators allow users to save in-progress games, most use different game save formats. For example, some Nintendo console emulators create SAV files that represent saved games. RetroArch is the only emulator that creates and loads STATE files.","NOTE: RetroArch users can check where their STATE files are stored by selecting Settings â†’ Directory from RetroArch's main menu."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/state_11764.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .state file in Github Atom","caption":"STATE file open in Github Atom"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"state.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
