The DIM raw disk image is mainly used for future data recovery or backing up non-Windows operating systems.","You can create a raw image by selecting \"Create Raw Image\" under \"Disk Operations\" or \"Tools\" on the menu bar. Two files are created when you create a raw disk image. A DIM file containing the image description is created while another file is created to hold the data. This data file is named after the name of the raw disk image and has \"001\" appended on to its \"dim\" extension. If your raw disk image is named \"DiskImage\", the data file would be named DiskImage.dim.001 . If more than one data file is needed, another file is created with \"002\" appended on to the extension."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"dim.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
