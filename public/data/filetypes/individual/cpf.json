While manipulating images, users can specify a number of compression- and resizing-related settings. For example, users can choose their desired image quality, file format, and size. Users can also specify where Caesium should save compressed images.","If a user wants to save their current Caesium settings, so they can quickly apply the settings in the future, they can do so by selecting File â†’ Save Profile... from Caesium's menu bar. This saves the user's settings in a CPF file.","CPF files are plain text files that, when opened in a text editor such as Microsoft Notepad, show a user's settings as a simple text list. CPF files always start with the header [Profile] , before listing a user's quality, format, output, and resizing settings."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/cpf_12350.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .cpf file in SaeraSoft Caesium","caption":"CPF file open in SaeraSoft Caesium"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"cpf.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
