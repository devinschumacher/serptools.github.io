They would name the files FILE_ID.DIZ , where FILE_ID stands for \"file identification\" and DIZ stands for \"Description in Zip file.\" The information contained in FILE_ID.DIZ files provided system administrators with helpful descriptions of each file uploaded to the system.","As the popularity of bulletin board systems declined over the years, FILE_ID.DIZ files became less common. However, DIZ files are still prominent in the Warez scene, a community of people illegally distributing copyrighted content. These users typically package FILE_ID.DIZ files with their ZIP distributions of unlicensed software."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"FILE_ID.DIZ","description":"FILE_ID.DIZ - Common filename for the DIZ text file that describes the content stored in a ZIP archive."}],"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/diz_1089.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .diz file in Microsoft Notepad 21","caption":"DIZ file open in Microsoft Notepad 21"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"diz.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
