One of the measurements XEASY records is a macromolecule's atom list. The atom list contains the name and frequencies of a macromolecule's resonances, and it is saved as a PROT file.","Each PROT file contains several rows of numerical and text values. Each row corresponds to an individual atom, and contains identifying information about that atom. In order, each atom's row includes:","To create an atom list in XEASY, scientists use the program's Write atoms (chem.shift) [wc] command. This produces a PROT file for the current macromolecule."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/prot_12995.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .prot file in GSL Biotech SnapGene 6","caption":"PROT file open in GSL Biotech SnapGene 6"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"prot.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
