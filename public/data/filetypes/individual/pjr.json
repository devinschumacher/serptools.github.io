It also allows users to make minor edits and corrections to those videos, as well as add subtitles.","When a user saves an in-progress DVDx project, the project is saved as a PJR file. The PJR file contains a record of the project's edits and settings, as well as references to the file's included media files. PJR files do not, themselves, contain any media files. If you delete or misplace a media file referenced in a PJR file, the file will not load correctly in DVDx."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pjr.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
