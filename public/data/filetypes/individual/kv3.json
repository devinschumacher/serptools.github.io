However, KV3 files also support binary encodings, versioning, and data annotations. They also include support for some additional text syntax .","Each KV3 file begins with a line that contains a kv3 encoding header. It then goes on to define how a game object behaves. For example, bt_default.kv3 is a KV3 behavior tree, which defines how CS:GO bots behave in deathmatches. Bt_default.kv3 contains references to other KV3 files, stored in CS:GO's scripts/​ai/​modules directory. Those KV3 files contain scripts that bots execute to perform in-game actions."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/kv3_12373.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .kv3 file in GitHub Atom","caption":"KV3 file open in GitHub Atom"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"kv3.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
