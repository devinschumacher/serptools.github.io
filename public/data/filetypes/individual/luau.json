In many cases, players themselves develop these sub-games, using Roblox game development tools like Roblox Studio.","Around 2006, Roblox began using Lua 5.1 as its game scripting language. However, the Roblox development team eventually felt that Lua 5.1 no longer fit their, or game developers', needs. To address this issue, Roblox created its own variant of Lua 5.1, named Luau.","Now, Roblox developers often save game source code in LUAU files. The code these files contain looks similar to the code found in .LUA files, and is designed to be backward-compatible with Lua 5.1 code. However, Luau uses its own compiler and runtime, developed and maintained by Roblox.","NOTE: Some .RBXM files contain LUAU scripts."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/luau_13199.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .luau file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"LUAU file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"luau.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
