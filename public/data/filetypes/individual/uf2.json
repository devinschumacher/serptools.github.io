For example, students can create their own video games using the MakeCode editor found at arcade.makecode.com. They can then download that video game as a UF2 file, transfer the file to their microcontroller-based video game console, and play the game on their microcontroller.","To transfer a UF2 file to a microcontroller, developers plug their microcontroller into their PC's USB drive. Their PC then recognizes the microcontroller as a flash drive , allowing the developer to drag their UF2 file to the microcontroller and install their MakeCode program."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/uf2_11832.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .uf2 file in Microsoft MakeCode Arcade","caption":"UF2 file open in Microsoft MakeCode Arcade"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"uf2.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
