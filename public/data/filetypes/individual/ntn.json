Most notably, NOTION used audio samples recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra, specifically for use with NOTION, to play back users' scores. This gave NOTION's playback a realistic, live performance-esque sound.","NOTION saved the scores that composers created as NTN files. When opened in NOTION, these scores appear as editable sheet music, consisting of a score title, author name, measures, notes, rests, tempo notation, and other musical notation."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ntn.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
