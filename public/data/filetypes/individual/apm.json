APM files instead use a 22-byte header. Because APM files use a non-standard header, Windows API metafile functions, such as GetMetaFile() , CopyMetaFile() , and PlayMetaFile , cannot read the files correctly. To use APM files with these functions, developers must first strip the files' headers using the program wmapmf.exe ."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"apm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
