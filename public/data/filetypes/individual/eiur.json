EIUR ransomware encrypts a user's documents, images, and videos, appends the .eiur extension to the encrypted files, and produces a ransom note named _readme.txt in every affected folder. The ransom note contains instructions users can supposedly follow to decrypt their files.","Ransomware is most commonly distributed in programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed an unverified program, that may be how your computer became infected by EIUR ransomware.","NOTE: EIUR ransomware is a variant of .STOP ransomware."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"eiur.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
