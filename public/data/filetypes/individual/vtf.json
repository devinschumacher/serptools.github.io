Games developed using the Source Engine use textures saved in the Valve Texture Format. These textures are usually created by converting a .TGA file to the VTF format, using Source's Vtex tool.","The texture a VTF file contains can typically be up to 4096 x 4096 pixels. Instead of a single texture, some VTF files contain environment maps, comprised of a six-faced cube, or volumetric textures, comprised of several, stacked 16 x 16 textures."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vtf.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
