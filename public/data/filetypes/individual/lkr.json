When compiling programs using MPLAB, developers use different compilers when targeting different microcontrollers. Version 8 of MPLAB includes support for the C18 compiler, used to compile programs for PIC18 microcontrollers.","When compiling a program using C18, developers previously had to manually specify a linker script used to merge their program's constituent files into a single program file. In the most recent version of C18, however, the compiler automatically selects an appropriate linker script from its ~mcc/​18/​bin/​LKR directory. These scripts are saved as LKR files.","NOTE: Other MPLAB products may also use linker scripts saved as LKR files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"lkr.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
