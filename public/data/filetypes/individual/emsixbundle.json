When packaging an application using MakeAppx.exe , developers can enter several commands that control how their app is packaged. For example, developers can choose to create an app bundle, which contains different versions of their app optimized for different processor architectures, and they can choose to encrypt that app bundle. Encrypted MSIX app bundles are saved as EMSIXBUNDLE files.","Typically, developers create EMSIXBUNDLE files when they don't want end users to be able to extract the constituent files their app bundle contains. For example, a video game developer may encrypt an app bundle that contains their video game so users cannot access the game's assets."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"emsixbundle.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
