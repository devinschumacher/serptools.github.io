This feature logs when and how many times you play video and audio on websites. After you choose to play video or audio on a website a certain number of times, Chrome automatically allows that website to autoplay video and audio.","When introducing MEI, Google created a default list of websites that could always autoplay videos and audio. This list is saved in the file preloaded_data.pb . After your browser determines a site should be allowed to autoplay video and audio, the browser adds that site to preloaded_data.pb . However, preloaded_data.pb is a binary file, so users cannot simply open the file to view or edit the website list it contains.","NOTE: In Windows, a browser's PB file is stored in its MEIPreload directory."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"Preloaded_data.pb","description":"Preloaded_data.pb - The default name of Chromium-based browsers' PB file."}],"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/pb_13210.png","alt":"PB file shown in Windows File Explorer","caption":"PB file shown in Windows File Explorer"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pb.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
