However, Happaning is unique in that while viewing a video, users can swipe in any direction to see a linked video recorded from another perspective. For example, if a Happaning user views a video recorded at a concert and swipes left, they'll see a different video recorded at the same concert, by another user.","Each video shown on the Happaning app is saved as a VII file. In addition to video data, VII files contain location and timestamp data used to synchronize them with other users' VII files. This allows Happaning to link videos together and show relevant videos when users swipe left, right, up, or down in the app."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vii.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
