UFED and Physical Analyzer are two of the suite's primary applications.","Both UFED and Physical Analyzer allow investigators to extract a device's contents and save them as a single .UFD file. However, if investigators are extracting data from multiple related devices, they may instead save all of the devices' contents as a UFDX file. This allows investigators to load all the devices' data as a single file while building a case in Physical Analyzer, and more easily share the data with other investigators if needed."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ufdx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
