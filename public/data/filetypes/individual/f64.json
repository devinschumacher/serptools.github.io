Additionally, F64 files are similar to .F32 files but store more raw data, allowing for a wider dynamic range of sound and greater accuracy. Because they contain more data, F64 files are significantly larger in size than F32 files"]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"f64.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
