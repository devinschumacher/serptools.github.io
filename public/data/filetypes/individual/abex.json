In addition to being able to produce normal Android backup files, Droid Explorer can produce ABEX, or enhanced Android backup, files. These files contain a unique header that links the backup they contain to a specific Android device, so the backup can be restored on only that device.","An example ABEX file header looks like:","ENHANCED ANDROID BACKUP\\n [DEVICE ID]\\n [Droid Explorer Version]\\n [ABEX Version]\\n $$$ ENHANCED ANDROID BACKUP $$$\\n","The backup the file contains begins beneath this header."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"abex.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
