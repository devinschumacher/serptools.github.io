Designers can then export their designs and provide them to printing companies, which use the designs to create physical marketing materials.","By default, users' VinylMaster designs are saved as VDOC files. This file format preserves the design's individual elements, allowing users to continue editing those elements in VinylMaster.","However, VDOC files can be opened only in VinylMaster. When providing VinylMaster designs to print shops, designers typically export the designs as EPS, PDF, or SVG files, using VinylMaster's File â†’ Export... option. That way, print shops can open and view the exported design, even if they don't have VinylMaster."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/vdoc_12232.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .vdoc file in VinylMaster Cut 4","caption":"VDOC file open in VinylMaster Cut 4"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vdoc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
