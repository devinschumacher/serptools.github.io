However, Wondershare replaced WVE and WSVE files with the .WFP project format when it released Filmora9 in December 2018. Filmora9 and later versions still support the WVE and WSVE file types.","You can export WVE projects to various video formats, including .WMV , .AVI , .MOV , .FLV , and .MP4 . You can automatically format the video for YouTube or various mobile devices.","WVE projects save references to video and music files, but not the files themselves. Therefore, to transfer a project, you must also copy the referenced files.","NOTE: Wondershare Filmora was formerly known as Wondershare Video Editor."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"wve.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
