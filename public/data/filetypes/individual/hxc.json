To create Help 2 content, developers used help authoring programs such as Help 2 Workshop. Help projects created using these programs stored their metadata in HXC files.","Each HXC file contains XML-formatted information that defines a project's contents, organization, and other information. After a developer finished creating their Help 2 project, they could use their HXC file to build a compiled .HXS file, used to actually deliver help content to users.","NOTE: Microsoft Help 2 was replaced by Microsoft Help Viewer, with the release of Visual Studio 2010."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"hxc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
