The data contained in the index XML file is now encoded in the IWA binary files, which are contained in the Index.zip file.","A Protobuf stream is a way of encoding structured data for more efficient data exchange. The encoded data is compressed with Snappy compression, a format widely used by Google and intended for high compression and decompression speeds. The format compresses around 250 MB /sec and decompresses close to 500 MB/sec.","NOTE: The IWA format was released with the iWork '13 suite."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"iwa.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
