When a user works on a tax return in TaxCut 2004 and saves their progress, the software creates the T04 file to store the information. After saving a tax return, users can close the T04 file, then reopen it to work on it further."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"t04.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
