Users can then export the vocals they've created as .UST or .MID files. Synthesizer V projects, which are saved as SVP files, often contain many different vocal tracks, including primary vocals, backing vocals, and effects applied to those vocals.","While SVP files appear as vocal tracks in Synthesizer V, they are actually plain text JSON files.
