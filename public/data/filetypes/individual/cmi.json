To begin building (i.e. creating an executable file for) an application they developed using OCaml, a developer must first compile the application's ML and MLI files. When the developer compiles their ML or MLI file, OCaml produces a CMI file.","The CMI file contains a compiled definition of the data types and variables included within the developer's application. Along with the CMO files created during the compilation process, the CMI file is used to continue constructing the application's executable file."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"cmi.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
