{"slug":"dock","extension":"dock","name":"Mac OS X Dock Extra","category":"mac-os-x-dock-extra","summary":"","developer_org":"apple","developer_name":"Apple","more_information":{"description":["In initial versions of Mac OS X, users could drag DOCK files, better known as Dock Extras, to their PC's dock to add minor settings- and notification-related programs to their dock. For example, users could drag the Battery Monitor Dock Extra to their dock to view their PC's current battery level and adjust their battery preferences. DOCK files were stored in the Macintosh HD/​Applications/​Dock Extras folder.","However, because Dock Extras took up too much space within users' docks, Apple began migrating Dock Extra features to the Mac OS X menu bar, where they appeared as Menu Extras. As of Mac OS X 10.2, DOCK files and Dock Extras became obsolete and unsupported, as all Dock Extras had been replaced by Menu Extras."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"dock.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
