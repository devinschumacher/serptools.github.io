When installing the software update, the S5L8900 application processor in the iPhone parses the file and loads its information.","IMG2 files store various information, including system software, resource files, and images. The files are also encrypted with the 0x837 key to protect their contents.","NOTE: Since Apple replaced IMG2 files, the format is now obscure, but iPhone users looking to jailbreak iPhones and flash old firmware onto them may still encounter IMG2 files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"img2.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
