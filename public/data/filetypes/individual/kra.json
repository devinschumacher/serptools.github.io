Since KRA files are compressed with Zip compression, you can also extract and examine the contents of the KRA files. You can use a Zip decompression utility, such as Windows File Explorer, 7-Zip, or Apple Archive Utility, but you must first rename the .kra file extension to .zip .","Krita is typically used by graphic artists, such as illustrators, concept artists, and texture artists. You can create and edit images with various painting, animation, and vector tools and masks. When you are finished editing your KRA image, you can export it to a different format, such as JPEG, PNG, or GIF.","NOTE: Since the KRA file is used to save all the information about an image, it can grow rather large in size."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/kra_11240.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .kra file in Krita 4","caption":"KRA file open in Krita 4"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"kra.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
