Texas Instruments released the original TI-73 in 1998; it released a follow-up model, the TI-73 Explorer, in 2003.","At this point, most students use a TI-83 or TI-84 calculator in place of the TI-73. Thus, 73K files are uncommon. Developers typically write the programs 73K files contain using Texas Instruments' TI-BASIC programming language, which is a variant of BASIC."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"73k.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
