The program allows teachers to host live virtual classroom sessions and record those sessions so students can revisit them in the future. While virtual classroom session recordings are typically stored on Electa Live's cloud servers, they can also be downloaded as EL8 files, to allow teachers and students to play back recordings while offline.","To download an Electa Live session as an EL8 file, go to the Resources section of the Electa Live admin menu. Then, select Recorded Classes , select the session you want to download, and download it.","After you download an Electa Live session as an EL8 file, you can manually share it with your students (e.g. via email, a USB drive, or another cloud storage service) to allow them to access and play the file in Electa Live.","NOTE: Electa Live recordings may also be saved with the .el7 , .el6 , .el5 , or .electa extensions."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"el8.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
