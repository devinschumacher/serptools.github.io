{"slug":"smp","extension":"smp","name":"AudioCuentos Audiobook","category":"audiocuentos-audiobook","summary":"","developer_org":"ulead","developer_name":"Ulead","more_information":{"description":["Both Salvat AudioCuentos and Märchenheld offer a series of children's audiobooks that are played by placing a figurine atop a square, blue audio player (sometimes referred to as an audio cube). The audio player contains a memory card that stores a number of SMP files, each of which contains an audiobook. When a child places a figurine atop the audio player, the player loads and plays that figurine's associated SMP file.","In most circumstances, those who use AudioCuentos and Märchenheld audiobooks should never have to encounter or manually open an SMP file. The only way you would encounter an SMP file is if you removed the memory card from an AudioCuentos or Märchenheld audio player and connected it to your computer."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"smp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
