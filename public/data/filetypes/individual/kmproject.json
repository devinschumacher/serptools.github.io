However, KMPROJECT files do not contain any video. Instead, KMPROJECT files contain references to the assets (videos, audio files, and images) included in a video editing project. They also include metadata used to correctly position layers upon KineMaster's video editing timeline.","If you move an asset referenced in your KMPROJECT file, the file may not load correctly in KineMaster. You can resolve the issue by moving the misplaced asset back to the location listed in your KMPROJECT file.","After you finish editing a KineMaster project, you can export the video you've created to Facebook, YouTube, Dropbox, or your mobile device."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"kmproject.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
