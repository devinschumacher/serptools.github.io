While users primarily downloaded and transferred M4R files with iTunes before Apple discontinued it, they could also manually transfer M4R files on their computer to their connected iPhone with a third-party file manager. After transferring an M4R file to their phone, they can set it as the ringtone on their iPhone by selecting Settings → Sounds & Haptics → Ringtone .","Additionally, users could create M4R files with iTunes, but they also may create them with third-party software programs or download them from the Internet.
