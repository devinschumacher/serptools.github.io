Once encoded to the ECM format, the ECM file can then be compressed using .RAR compression or another compression algorithm. The resulting compressed size can be 15-20% smaller than the equivalent full disc compressed image.","To restore the original CD image from a compressed ECM file (e.g., image.nrg.ecm.rar ), first decompress the file to a raw ECM file, and then restore the original CD image from the ECM file using the ECM software, which contains a decompression program called unecm.exe ."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ecm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
