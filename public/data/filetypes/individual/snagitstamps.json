One of the ways users can annotate screenshots is by adding stamps to them, using Snagit's Stamp tool. For example, a user might add numbered stamps to a screenshot, to label the UI elements associated with a step-based list.","If a user wants to add additional stamps to Snagit, they can select the Download More button available in the Stamp tool. Selecting this button opens the online Snagit asset library, from which users can download additional stamp packs as SNAGITSTAMPS files.","NOTE: Users cannot directly add stamps to Snagit videos. However, users can include stamps in Snagit videos by creating the video from a series of images that already contain stamps."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/snagitstamps_8989.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .snagitstamps file in Snagit 2022","caption":"SNAGITSTAMPS file open in Snagit 2022"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"snagitstamps.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
