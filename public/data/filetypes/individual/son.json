In the 1990s, Beam produced a handful of games that use their proprietary SIFF file format, including KKND2: Krossfire and The Lost Vikings II.","The SIFF file format can be used to create files that contain both audio and video or just audio. When a SIFF format file contains both audio and video, it is saved with the .VB extension. When it contains just audio, it is saved using the .son extension.","NOTE: Some games developed using Ubisoft LyN engine, such as The Adventures of Tintin, also use SON format audio files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"son.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
