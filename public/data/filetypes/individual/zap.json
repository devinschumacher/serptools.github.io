Users for whom the administrator has provided access can use the ZAP published applications locally on their computers. For permitted users, the applications appear in the user's Add/Remove Programs list. Group Policy management is included as part of the Windows Server software.","You can create and edit ZAP files with any text editor. For example, you can create a plain text ( .TXT ) file in Microsoft Notepad and change the file extension to \".zap\" when complete.","NOTE: ZAP files have limitations that traditional MSI installers do not.
