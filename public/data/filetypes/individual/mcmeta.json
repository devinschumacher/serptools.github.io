One of the ways players modify Minecraft is by replacing the game's default textures, items, sounds, music, and animations with their own.","To do this, players create custom resource packs that contain their modified game assets. In its top-level directory, each resource pack contains a pack.mcmeta file. This file specifies the resource pack's name, as well as what version of Minecraft (Java Edition) the pack is meant to be used with.","Resource packs may contain additional MCMETA files, which are used to modify how textures behave in the game. For example, an MCMETA file named stone.png.mcmeta may contain code used to animate or alter the stone.png texture. These MCMETA files are stored in resource pack sub-directories, alongside the textures they modify.","NOTE: Minecraft (Bedrock Edition) does not use resource packs that contain MCMETA files. Instead, that game uses .MCPACK files."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"pack.mcmeta","description":"pack.mcmeta - A metadata file that Minecraft Java Edition uses to show a resource pack and its name in the Select Resource Packs menu."}],"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/mcmeta_8794.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .mcmeta file in GitHub Atom","caption":"MCMETA file open in GitHub Atom"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mcmeta.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
