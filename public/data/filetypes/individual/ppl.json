This compatibility enables developers to integrate Free Pascal libraries into broader software ecosystems, extending their utility beyond Pascal-based projects.","NOTE: Due to the emergence of newer development ecosystems, programming languages, and library formats, PPL files are largely obscure. However, developers working with legacy and niche Pascal projects may still encounter them."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ppl.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
