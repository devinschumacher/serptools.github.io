While Drive for Desktop stores actual backups of some types of files (such as .JPG and .DOCX files) on users' computers, it does not store copies of files created using Google Drawings, Docs, Slides, and other Google Workspace applications. Instead, Drive for Desktop stores shortcut files that, when double-clicked, open the associated file in the web version of the correct Google Workspace application.","GDRAW files are Drive for Desktop shortcuts that open diagrams created in Google Drawings. When a Drive for Desktop user double-clicks a GDRAW file, the related diagram opens in Google Drawings, provided the user is signed in to a Gmail account allowed to access the diagram. Each GDRAW file is a JSON file that contains a diagram's URL and document ID, as well as the name of the Gmail account used to create the diagram.","NOTE: GDRAW files were previously created by Backup and Sync from Google. Google replaced Backup and Sync with Drive for Desktop in October 2021."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/gdraw_7630.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .gdraw file in GitHub Atom","caption":"GDRAW file open in GitHub Atom"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gdraw.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
