The #TASK tool can be used as a companion to the CAD package for running scripts that will perform repetitive tasks and save the user time.","An example of a task that can be saved as a script is modifying the image quality of several hundred .SLDDRW files created by SolidWorks. Instead of opening and adjusting each drawing, the task can be recorded as a script. Then, the user can import all of the SLDDRW files in #TASK and run the script to adjust the image quality of each drawing. This will take the user several minutes compared to several hours if he was to do it manually.","To open an STS script with #TASK, select the + symbol in the \"Tasks\" pane, then select the STS file you want to run. You can also click the globe icon to download an STS script from the #TASK online library.","NOTE: #TASK is pronounced \"Sharp Task.\""]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/sts_11497.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .sts file in Microsoft Notepad","caption":"STS file open in Microsoft Notepad"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sts.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
