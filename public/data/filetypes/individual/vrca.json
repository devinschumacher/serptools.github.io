{"slug":"vrca","extension":"vrca","name":"VRChat Avatar","category":"vrchat-avatar","summary":"","developer_org":"unity-technologies","developer_name":"Unity Technologies","more_information":{"description":["VRChat is a virtual reality program that allows users to don a VR headset and microphone, assume a virtual identity, and socialize within a variety of unique worlds. When creating their VRChat character, players can select one of the platform's default avatars or create a custom avatar. VRChat's servers store avatars as VRCA files.","Unlike .VRCW files, players are not meant to share, download, open, or edit VRCA files. While players can create custom VRChat avatars using the Unity game development engine, those avatars are uploaded directly to the player's VRChat account and converted to VRCA files in the process. However, some players have found ways to download publicly-accessible VRCA files from VRChat using the game's avatars API, and custom VRCA files are available on several VRChat-related websites."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vrca.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
