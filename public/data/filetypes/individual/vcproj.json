The development kit includes an integrated development environment ( IDE ) and testing tools for the various stages of the software development process.","Developers using versions of Visual Studio before 2010 start by creating a new project (and associated project file). The project file contains the information MSBuild needs to compile the developer's project into an executable program.","Additionally, specific types of Visual Studio projects use specific types of Visual Studio project files. For example, Visual C++ projects use VCPROJ (now VCXPROJ) project files."]},"how_to_open":{"detailed_instructions":["You can open VCPROJ files with Microsoft Visual Studio in Windows as part of Visual Studio projects. Visual Studio automatically converts VCPROJ files to VCXPROJ files when opening them.","Since VCPROJ files store information in the XML standard, you can open and edit them with any text or source code editor. However, incorrectly editing a VCPROJ file may corrupt the project."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vcproj.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
