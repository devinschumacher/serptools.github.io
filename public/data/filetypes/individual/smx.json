SourceMod is an add-on for Source Engine games, which allows players to customize their multiplayer game servers using various plug-ins, saved as SMX files.","Each SMX file contains scripts written in the SourcePawn scripting language, which modders developed specifically for use with SourceMod and Source Engine games. However, these scripts are compiled, so you cannot just open the SMX file to view them. Instead, you must decompile the SMX file, using one of many available SMX decompilers.","NOTE: Typically, modders compile SourcePawn scripts into SMX files with the online SourceMod Plug-in Compiler ."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"smx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
