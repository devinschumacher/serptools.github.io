{"slug":"tpu","extension":"tpu","name":"Turbo Pascal Unit","category":"turbo-pascal-unit","summary":"","developer_org":"borland","developer_name":"Borland","more_information":{"description":["Turbo Pascal is a development kit for the Pascal programming language. It includes an IDE and a compiler that allow developers to develop, compile, and run Pascal programs.","Versions 4 and later of Turbo Pascal allow developers to compile program modules into TPU files. Typically, these modules contain common functions and procedures that a developer wants to include in multiple programs. Storing these functions and procedures in a single TPU file, rather than rewriting them in each program, makes maintaining and troubleshooting them easier.","Each TPU file is built from a corresponding .PAS file. These PAS files start with the unit keyword; they are typically named similarly to their TPU counterparts.","NOTE: Different versions of Turbo Pascal use differently-formatted TPU files. Therefore, TPU files created using one version of Turbo Pascal may not function correctly in other versions."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tpu.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
