Players can use A Better Place’s level editor to create their own worlds and rooms, for custom gameplay.","Each set of A Better Place worlds and rooms is saved in a WORLDPACK file. Typically, the worlds a WORLDPACK file contains are related to each other somehow (for example, they’re used to tell an A Better Place side story).","After a player finishes creating a world pack, they can use the level editor to share that WORLDPACK file with others, by emailing it, messaging it, or uploading it to the Internet. WORLDPACK files are cross-platform compatible. For example, a world pack created in Android will work with the Windows version of Cats Are Liquid: A Better Place."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"worldpack.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
