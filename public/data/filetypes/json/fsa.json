      "FSA files are created to store fragment data acquired by data collection software during an electrophoresis run (laboratory technique used to separate and analyze macromolecules based on size). The data is used to determine DNA sequence genotypes. If you don't work or study in a DNA-related scientific field you most likely will never come across an FSA file.",
      "If you do find an FSA file and need to open it you can choose from several fragment analysis programs, such as Peak Scanner Software. These programs can be used to size, display, edit, and print FSA files. The applications process the raw data in the FSA file with algorithms and displays the data according to user-specified analysis settings. If you want to convert the FSA file to a more common image format you can use the FSA2PS program to convert the data to PostScript images.",
      "FSA files collected by Applied Biosystems applications will most likely be located in the following directory:",
