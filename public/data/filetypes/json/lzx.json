      "In 1995, Jonathan Forbes and Tomi Poutanen released the LZX utility for Amiga computers. It was available as both shareware and a paid application. It allowed users to compress one or more files and store them in LZX archives.",
      "These days, LZX files are uncommon. However, Amiga users may still possess LZX files, stored on hard drives, floppy disks, or other storage media."
