      "MPG files typically incorporate MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 audio and video compression . MPEG-1 is one of the most widely used lossy video/audio formats in the world since it is supported by a large number of video and audio applications. MPEG-2 was developed to improve on the shortcomings of MPEG-1, which includes only a two-channel audio compression system and insufficient support for the demands of higher resolution video.",
      "MPG files are saved in a program stream container format known as PS or MPEG-PS. The format stores audio, video, and metadata that has been interleaved together in one stream for efficient deliverability."
