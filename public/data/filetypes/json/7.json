      "Man pages are system-level documentation that describes the inner workings of a Unix-like operating system. These pages are typically grouped into sections that contain a related set of documentation.",
      "The seventh section of most Unix manuals, however, contains miscellaneous important pieces of information that do not fit neatly into the manual's other seven categories. Each page of that section is saved as a 7 file.",
      "NOTE: Other sections' Unix man pages use the .1 , .2 , .3 , .4 , .5 , .6 , and .8 extensions. Man pages are also commonly compressed into .GZ files (which may use the .gz.# extension)."
