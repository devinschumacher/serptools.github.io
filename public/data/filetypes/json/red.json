      "The Red programming language was introduced in 2011 and designed to improve upon the Rebol programming language. Nenad Rakočević developed Red to be a full-stack language where a developer could create the front-end and back-end of software.",
      "NOTE: While RED files store Red source code, .REDS files contain a low-level dialect of the Red programming language, known as Red/System."
