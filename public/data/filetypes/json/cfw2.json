      "PopCap Games is a popular video game developer known for publishing the Plants Vs. Zombies and Bejeweled series of games. Many of the developer's games use fonts saved as CFW2 files.",
      "In mobile games, such as Peggle 2, each game's CFW2 files are saved in its .RSB asset archives. In Windows games, such as the Windows versions of Bejeweled Twist and Bejeweled 3, each game's CFW2 files are saved in the ProgramData/​GameName/​cached/​fonts directory.",
      "CFW2 files are typically named for the font they are used to load. For example, Peggle 2 contains a CFW2 file named COURIERFINALDRAFT8.TXT.CFW2 . This is used to apply the Courier Final Draft font and font size 8 to certain in-game text."
