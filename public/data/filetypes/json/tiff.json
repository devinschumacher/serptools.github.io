      "Aldus Corporation released the TIFF format in the mid-1980s to be a standard image format for saving high-quality color images on multiple computer platforms. Although it was widely adopted, the JPEG format surpassed it over the years because it was more efficient and web-friendly.",
      "Now, graphic designers and professional printers typically save digital photos and graphics in the TIFF format for editing and printing purposes. They may save the images as TIFF or .TIF files.",
      "NOTE: Aldus Corporation merged with Adobe Systems in 1994."
