      "LÖVE is an open-source game engine that runs 2D video games built with the Lua scripting language. Game developers can program 2D games with LÖVE and distribute them as LOVE files to Windows, macOS, Linux, or Android users. To play the game packaged in the LOVE file end-users only need to install the free LÖVE program on their computer.",
      "To create a LOVE file, first create the main.lua file and other game resources, then compress them into a .ZIP file and rename the file extension from .zip to .love . Make sure the main.lua file is in the top-most directory level of the Zip archive."
