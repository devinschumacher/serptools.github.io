      "Skylanders is a series of adventure video games that is paired with an accompanying toy line. To play as new characters in Skylanders, players place a toy representing that character on the Skylanders Portal (aka Portal of Power), a peripheral device connected to their gaming console or PC.",
      "Players playing Skylanders in a video game console emulator may not own or be able to use a Skylanders Portal. For this reason, some emulators, including RPCS3 and Dolphin, include built-in systems that emulate the Portal. RPCS3 was the first emulator to include this built-in version of the Skylanders Portal; it supports creating and loading Skylanders saved as SKY files.",
      "When a Skylander saved as a SKY file levels up or collects coins, that progress is saved to the SKY file. This allows players to load their leveled-up Skylanders while playing different games in different emulators."
