      "Songs2See is a software suite that helps aspiring musicians learn to play musical instruments. It consists of Songs2See Game, a program that allows musicians to play along with a piece of music, and Songs2See Editor, a program that allows musicians to create custom songs for use with Songs2See Game.",
      "In Songs2See Editor, musicians can import, record, and edit songs, using a variety of specialized editing tools. If a musician chooses to save a song creation project (for example, so they can continue editing the song in the future), it is saved as an S2S file.",
      "The S2S format is a proprietary format used only by Songs2See Editor. If a user wants to use the song an S2S file contains with Songs2See Game, they must first open that file in Songs2See Editor and convert it to an S2P file."
