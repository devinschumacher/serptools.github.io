      "In 2016, users began reporting the existence of Globe ransomware. Globe infects a user's computer, encrypts and renames the user's files, and then produces a ransom note named How to restore files.hta . It then automatically opens the ransom note. It also changes the user's desktop background to an image that contains characters from the movie Purge: Election Year.",
      "At this time, it is unknown exactly how Globe ransomware is distributed. However, ransomware is most often distributed via spam email attachments and programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles.",
      "FileInfo recommends you never pay a ransom to decrypt your files. Also, free decryption tools exist that may allow you to restore your PURGE files to their normal state.",
      "NOTE: Variants of Globe ransomware append users' files with the .globe or .xtbl extension, instead of .purge ."
