      "TurboTax is an application that provides step-by-step guidance for preparing and filing U.S. Federal and State tax returns. While the software is available for the web as TurboTax Online, only the downloadable desktop version for macOS supports 3ME files.",
      "The Mac version of TurboTax saves each 3ME file with a corresponding .3PE file inside the TurboTax application package. When the program is updated, old 3ME and 3PE files are moved to the trash. Therefore, these files can be safely deleted after the program is updated."
