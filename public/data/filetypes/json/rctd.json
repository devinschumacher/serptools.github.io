      "RabbitCTRunner uses the RCTD file to reconstruct the benchmark. This process consists of three steps: Download RabbitCTRunner and the RCTD Dataset from the website (the link is located below under the Windows, Mac, and Linux programs). Download a precompiled back projection module, e.g., LolaBunny, or implement your own backprojection module. Execute RabbitCTRunner from the command line. This will produce a volume file and an encoded result file that can be uploaded to the RabbitCT servers. NOTE: The RCTD file can be downloaded from the same page that the RabbitCTRunner application is downloaded from.",
