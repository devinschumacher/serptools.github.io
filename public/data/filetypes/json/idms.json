      "You can create an IDMS file by selecting one or more objects in a document, such as an .INDD or .INDT file, and dragging and dropping them to the desktop. You can also export a snippet with InDesign by selecting File â†’ Export... and choosing \"InDesign Snippet\" from the \"Format\" dropdown list.",
      "NOTE: Previous versions of InDesign saved snippets as .INDS files. However, Adobe replaced INDS files with IDMS when it released InDesign CS4."
