      "In 2019, indie game A Dance of Fire and Ice gave players the ability to create their own custom levels. To do so, players upload an MP3 or OGG file into the game's Custom Level Editor and create a level to accompany the audio file. A Dance of Fire and Ice saves players' custom levels in ADOFAI files, which are stored in a folder alongside the MP3 or OGG file used to create the level.",
      "NOTE: Because only the Windows and Mac versions of A Dance of Fire and Ice include the Custom Level Editor, you can create and open ADOFAI files in only those versions."
