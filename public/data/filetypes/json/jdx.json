      "The JCAMP-DX format is primarily utilized for storing various types of chemical data, such as infrared absorption, nuclear magnetic resonance, and optical emission. Chemists collect their data with specific spectrometer instruments and save it in the JCAMP-DX format in JDX files. They then share the JDX file(s) in their reports to be viewed by other chemists along with an analysis of their findings.",
      "NOTE: The Subcommittee for Electronic Standards, which is part of The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), oversees the JCAMP-DX format."
