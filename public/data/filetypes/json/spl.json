      "FutureWave designed FutureSplash Animator to create compact and scalable animations that developers could embed into websites or users could view in compatible players. Macromedia acquired FutureWave in 1996, which Adobe later acquired in 2005. Adobe turned FutureSplash Animator into Adobe Flash, which supported SPL files until Adobe discontinued it when modern web standards like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript became prevalent."
