      "Musicians, podcasters, and others use the ZOOM H6 portable audio recorder to record spoken or musical audio. The H6 can record and save up to six channels of audio. It stores recordings on its SD card.",
      "To allow users to play back recordings, the ZOOM H6 stores information about each recording session in an HPRJ file. For example, a recording's HPRJ file details how many channels of audio the recording includes and where each channel's corresponding WAV file is located. Notably, HPRJ files are not audio files. They are also saved in a proprietary binary file format, so you cannot open them to view the metadata they contain."
