      "Despite using a different extension, JPG_SMALL files are just normal JPG files that have been resized using Twitter's small JSON entity size specification. Twitter appends the small specification to the image's URL when a Twitter user opens it in a new tab, creating a URL that ends in .jpg:small . When a user downloads the image in Chrome, the web browser saves it with the .jpg_small file extension, producing a JPG_SMALL file.",
      "For example, when you open a small-sized image stored on Twitter's media server in a new Google Chrome tab, Chrome accesses the image at a URL that looks like this:",
      "https:/​/​pbs.twimg.com/​media/​FHpjz6vX0AQekFS.jpg:small",
      "If you download the image from this page, Chrome saves the image as a JPG_SMALL file.",
      "NOTE: Twitter now uses the following URL structure to prevent the creation of JPG_SMALL files: https:/​/​pbs.twimg.com/​media/​FIcYYapXIAUy6Lz?format=jpg&name=small"
