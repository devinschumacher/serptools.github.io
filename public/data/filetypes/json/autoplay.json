      "Developers and content creators across various industries, such as education, marketing, software deployment, and technical documentation, may utilize AutoPlay Media Studio and AUTOPLAY files to create simple, self-contained applications without needing extensive programming knowledge. Once an AUTOPLAY project is complete, a user can export it as a standalone executable or burn it to a CD/DVD for distribution.",
      "AUTOPLAY files contain settings such as window size, page arrangement, scripting logic, and references to multimedia files used in the project. The actual media files (images, videos, audio, .BTN buttons, etc.) are typically stored in a folder named CD_Root , which is saved in the same directory as the AUTOPLAY project file. This structure keeps all project components organized and portable.",
      "NOTE: Version 8 of AutoPlay Media Studio introduced the AUTOPLAY project format. Previous versions were saved as .AM7 , .AM6 , etc., files with the number related to the version of the software saving the project."
