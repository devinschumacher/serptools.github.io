      "Ableton Live doesn't create ALC files for every imported audio file. For example, if you import a .WAV file, it will keep the WAV file in its original form. However, if you edit the WAV file and save it to your library, then the software creates a new ALC file.",
      "NOTE: Ableton Live creates .ASD audio metadata files when creating ALC clips. This helps speed up the process of using the audio clip."
