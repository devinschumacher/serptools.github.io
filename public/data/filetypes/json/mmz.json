      "MMZ files can be opened with MiraMon or with their free program MiraMon Universal Map Reader. These programs can be used to both view and run searches on maps contained within MMZ files. MiraMon can also be used to create and edit maps. In order to access different layers of the maps stored in an MMZ it must first be uncompressed into a .MMM file."
