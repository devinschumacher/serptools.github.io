      "Flatpak developed the Flatpak ( .FLATPAK ) format to simplify app distribution for the many variants of the Linux operating system. By providing a consistent distribution format, app developers can better deploy updates to their apps and more easily reproduce bugs reported by their users.",
      "The Flatpak Ref format is particularly tailored to the distribution of Linux apps on online app stores like Flathub since they contain additional app and installation information. Most users who encounter FLATPAKREF files do so when downloading an application from Flathub. Developers can submit their apps to the Flathub online service, and once their app is approved, users can find the apps and download them as FLATPAKREF files."
