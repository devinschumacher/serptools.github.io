      "Planetside Software released Terragen Classic in the late 1990s. It was popular among hobbyists, digital artists, and early visual effects creators for producing sky, terrain, and lighting environments before more advanced tools became available.",
      "The TGW format was specific to Terragen Classic and newer versions of Terragen do not support it. Because the software is no longer actively developed, TGW files are obscure and primarily only of interest to users maintaining legacy projects or exploring classic digital landscape tools."
