      "An OBJ file can reference more than one MTL file, and MTL files can reference more than one texture. In this way, users can easily apply multiple textures to the same object.",
      "While MTL files are primarily used and generated by 3D object editing applications, they are saved in the plain text format, allowing users to open and edit them in most any text editor."
