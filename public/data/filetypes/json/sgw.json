      "n-Track Studio is a DAW for recording, editing, and mixing songs from recorded audio, samples, and beats. As you compose a song in the software, you can create and save your progress in an SNG Song Project file or an SGW Packed Song Project file.",
      "The advantage of saving a song as an SGW file is that n-Track Studio packs all the project information and imported audio files together. As a result, you will likely find SGW files helpful when backing up projects or transferring them. In contrast, the SNG file saves references to the imported audio files. In this case, while the SNG file will be smaller, you will break the references to the audio files if you move or delete them."
