      "Mapbox's MBTILES format allows users to save detailed collections of geospatial information as a single map. For example, the map an MBTILES file contains might be overlaid with information about hiking trails, utility lines, administrative boundaries, and/or points of interest.",
      "MBTILES maps are comprised of vector- or raster-based tiles, which contain map images. When a user zooms in on a particular tile, mapping programs show that tile (and the surrounding area) in more detail. Because they are comprised of tiles, MBTILES files are often referred to as tilesets."
