      "Quicken is a personal finance application that manages and tracks multiple financial accounts. Intuit initially released Quicken in 1983, and the software has used various file types through its different versions to save data.",
      "For example, versions 3 and 4 of Quicken used the .QDT format to store data before replacing it with the QDB format. Intuit then replaced the QDB format with the .QDF format in versions 98, 99, and 2000 of Quicken.",
      "NOTE: Intuit sold Quicken to H.I.G. Capital in 2016, then H.I.G. sold Quicken to Aquiline Capital Partners in 2021. Quicken Inc. now develops Quicken."
