      "VDF files can often be seen when installing games distributed through Valve's Steam game client, such as Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike. The file features Valve's KeyValues format, which is a plain text format that saves key-value parameters in a tree hierarchy. The format is similar to JSON and YAML. While VDF files are meant to be used by the Valve Source game engine, you can open the files with a text editor to view the contents.",
      "Steam, which is a video game digital distribution service and storefront, also uses the VDF format. For example, Steam Auto-Cloud allows apps to use Steam Cloud (a remote file storage system for games) without modifying the game. In this case, it creates a steam_autocloud.vdf file in the location(s) specified by the Steamworks cloud paths."
