      "Ad Lib, Inc. developed Ad Lib Visual Composer to enable users to compose music using FM synthesis on Ad Lib-compatible sound cards. FM synthesis is a sound generation method that creates complex waveforms by modulating one sound wave (the carrier) with another (the modulator) to produce rich, harmonically complex tones ideal for electronic music, game soundtracks, and early computer music. This method became popular in the 1980s, especially in Ad Lib sound cards and Yamaha's DX-series synthesizers.",
      "Ad Lib, Inc. went bankrupt in the early 1990s, and Sound Blaster sound cards from Creative Labs largely replaced its technology, offering improved audio capabilities. Today, retro computing enthusiasts mainly use Ad Lib Visual Composer, running it through DOS emulators like DOSBox to recreate the classic Ad Lib FM synthesis sound.",
      "NOTE: Initially designed for Ad Lib hardware, some ROL files were also compatible with certain Roland MIDI interfaces, such as the MPU-401. However, because Ad Lib's FM synthesis differs from traditional MIDI-based sound generation, direct compatibility with Roland hardware was limited."
