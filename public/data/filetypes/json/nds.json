      "Gamers who enjoy playing retro, discontinued games for the NDS on their computers may use NDS files. The gamers may create NDS files by dumping the game data from the original cartridge onto a computer and packaging it as an NDS file. Gamers may also download NDS files from game emulator websites already dumped from game cartridges.",
      "A variety of emulators are available for playing NDS games, including DeSmuME, NO$GBA, iDeaS Emulator, and OpenEmu. Some features emulators provide include enhanced game graphics, helpful gameplay settings, and new \"cheat\" options.",
      "NOTE: Nintendo released the NDS in 2004, using two screens, one of which is touch-sensitive. DS stands for \"Dual Screen.\""
