      "In the early 2000s, programmer Terry A. Davis began creating an operating system that came to be known as TempleOS. Davis, who was a schizophrenic, claimed that God commanded him to create TempleOS. While the operating system is most useful for creating simple video games, it includes a number of biblical references, including a game named After Egypt. Davis claimed that a number of the OS's specifications were set down by God, and after publishing TempleOS in 2013, Davis announced that \"God's temple is finished.\"",
      "As part of developing TempleOS, Davis also developed the Holy C programming language. Holy C is a variant of the C programming language that is used only by TempleOS. Those who create TempleOS programs write those programs in Holy C, and they save and distribute their work in HC files."
