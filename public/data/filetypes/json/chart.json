      "Most guitar rhythm gamers will not encounter the CHART file unless they are looking to modify notes or create their own. If you want to modify notes, you can open and edit CHART files using FeedBack and Moonscraper Chart Editor.",
      "You can also use a text editor, such as Notepad or TextEdit, since the CHART file is stored in plain text. However, this method is not as convenient as the FeedBack and Moonscraper Chart Editor options, which provide an interface for modifying the notes. In a CHART file, N represents a note and S represents a star power phrase.",
      "NOTE: You can import CHART files into Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock and Guitar Hero: Aerosmith using Guitar Hero Three Control Panel (GHTPC)."
