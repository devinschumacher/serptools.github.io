      "Extensible Markup Language, or XML, is a markup language developers use to structure data. XML files contain datasets structured using XML.",
      "XML allows developers to structure data using custom tags. This flexibility makes XML ideal for cataloging information about nearly any set of related items. For example, a developer creating a catalog of automobiles may include the following entry in their XML file:",
      "<auto> <manufacturer>Tesla</manufacturer> <model>S</model> <horsepower>670 to 1,020</horsepower> <price>$69,420+</price> </auto>",
      "Because websites and applications can easily process XML, and humans can easily understand the data XML files contain, XML has become a standard way of transferring data over the Internet and between programs. XML is also used to structure the data contained within other types of files, such as Microsoft Office Open XML Documents ( .DOCX , .PPTX , .XLSX ), LibreOffice OpenDocuments ( .ODT , .ODP , .ODS ), .XHTML files, and .SVG files."
