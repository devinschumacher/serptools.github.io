      "After storing a WBFS file on a USB drive, players can run the file (and play the game it contains) on their Wii using USB Loader GX, an application that loads WBFS disk images. This process is, of course, unofficial and not supported by Nintendo. Players can also use Wii emulators, such as Dolphin, to play the game a WBFS file contains.",
      "Since WBFS files do not store the padding present in official Wii disk images, WBFS files' size is typically much smaller than the games from which they were created. In the past, WBFS files were sometimes paired with .WBF1 files, to allow USB loaders to process and play large games."
