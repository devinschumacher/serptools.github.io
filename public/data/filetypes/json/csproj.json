      "When developers create a new program in Microsoft Visual Studio, they start by creating a new project and associated project file. The project file contains information that MSBuild uses to compile the developer's project into an executable program. Specific types of Visual Studio projects use specific types of Visual Studio project files; C# projects use CSPROJ files.",
      "CSPROJ files define a project's content, platform requirements, versioning information, and web server or database server settings. They also list the files that are part of the project. All this information is defined using MSBuild's XML schema , which use the following elements (among others):",
      "To build a C# application developed in Visual Studio, a developer invokes MSBuild.exe from the Windows command-line interface along with the name of their CSPROJ file. For example, to build a project named MyProject.csproj , a developer would enter the command MSBuild.exe MyProject.csproj in the command prompt, along with any other appropriate command-line options."
