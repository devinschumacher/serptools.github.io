      "GNU gettext is a toolkit that helps programmers and translators produce user interface translation files. Most of these files are saved as PO files (others are saved as .POT files). Each PO file includes one or more entries, which associate an original, untranslated string(s) with its corresponding translation(s). The original text follows the identifier msgid ; the translation follows the identifier msgstr .",
      "All translations in a single PO file are written in the same translation language. If a program requires multiple languages' worth of translations, it will use multiple PO files."
