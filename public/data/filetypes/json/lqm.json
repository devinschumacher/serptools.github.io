      "The QuickMemo app allows you to take a screenshot of your phone screen or import an image and add notes, drawings, or memos to the image. When you are finished marking up the image you can save it in the LQM format. This is a convenient feature, however, the LQM format is not widely supported. You can also choose to export the note as a .JPG image or .PDF file, which are more widely supported.",
      "NOTE: QuickMemo comes pre-installed on select LG phones and tablets. It is not available for download."
