      "ESRI ArcGIS is a mapping and geoanalysis application that allows users to import, edit, annotate, analyze, and otherwise manipulate geographic data. To help them manipulate data, ArcGIS users can access and create toolboxes that contain a collection of related GIS tools. Advanced users can code their own toolboxes and custom tools using the Python programming language. These toolboxes are saved as PYT files.",
      "To create a new PYT file in ArcGIS:",
      "Each PYT file is created from the same template, which uses the Toolbox and Tool classes to define the toolbox's name and included tools. Users can add any number of tools to their PYT file, by adding additional instances of the Tool class."
