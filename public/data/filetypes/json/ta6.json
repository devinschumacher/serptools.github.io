      "Since annual tax returns are filed for the previous year, the TA6 file is commonly created in 2017 from the beginning of January to April 15. A TA6 file can be saved by the desktop version of TaxAct or exported from TaxAct Online. Once you have completed a tax return, you can either print and mail in the tax forms or file electronically.",
      "TA6 files prepared by TaxAct desktop users (Free Federal, Basic, Plus, and Premium) are located in the \"TaxAct2016\" folder in your \"My Documents\" folder.",
      "If you are worried about your tax return becoming corrupt or getting lost you can create a backup of your tax return select File â†’ Backup... and name your file. A backup tax return will be created and saved as a .BA6 file. It is important to note that you must save your tax return before creating your backup.",
      "NOTE: The TA6 file replaced the .TA5 file, which is used for 2015 tax returns created by the 2016 version of TaxAct."
