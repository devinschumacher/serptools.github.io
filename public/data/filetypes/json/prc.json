      "Adobe Systems developed the PRC file format to allow engineers, architects, and other CAD software users to more easily share 3D models with each other, as part of PDF-based documentation workflows. Each PRC file contains a product's structure, geometry, and product manufacturing information (PMI).",
      "Adobe Acrobat Pro Extended 8 and 9 and Adobe Acrobat 3D allowed users to create PRC files and embed them in PDF files. Current versions of Acrobat do not allow users to create new PRC files, but they can still open, view, and embed previously-created PRC files."
