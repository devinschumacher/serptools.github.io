      "The purpose of Dharma ransomware is to take your files hostage and force you to pay the perpetrator, typically through bitcoin, to unlock your files. Once the virus infiltrates your computer, often via email attachment from an unknown sender, it begins scrambling your files, renaming them, and encrypting them. The virus then generates a .TXT ransom note ( FILES ENCRYPTED.txt ) informing you of the takeover and what you need to do to recover your files.",
      "The virus renames your files using the following naming convention:",
      "[filename].id-[ID].[ [email protected] ].bip",
      "For example, if you have a sample.xlsx file it becomes [email protected] file."
