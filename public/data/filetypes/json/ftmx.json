      "MakeMusic Finale is a music notation program that allows composers to create, edit, and play back musical scores. If a composer does not want to begin creating a score from scratch, they can open one of Finale's many included score templates. These templates contain default notation, text, and other settings that make it easier for a composer to create particular types of scores.",
      "Finale 2014 to 26 save templates as FTMX files. These files are located in the following directory:",
      "~/​MakeMusic/​Finale ##/​Music Files/​Templates",
      "Composers can also create their own FTMX files, by using File → Save As... to save a score they've created as an FTMX file. It is recommended that composers save the templates they create in the Templates directory, to make managing templates easier.",
      "NOTE: Finale 2012 and earlier versions save templates as .FTM files. Finale 27 saves templates as .MUSX files.",
      "To create a new score from an FTMX file:",
      "Finale's Document Setup Wizard will then open, in which you can specify information about your new score."
