      "PLAYGROUND files are used to save testing areas for new source code. Once the developer is happy with results of the code in the playground, the source code can then be promoted to the main project. If you'd like to manually browse the contents of a PLAYGROUND file, right-click it and select Show Package Contents from the drop down menu.",
