      "In 1990, a group of game developers from French publisher ERE Informatique left that company to form CRYO Interactive Entertainment. CRYO released a number of popular video games, including Dune, Black Moon Chronicles, and Atlantis: The Lost Tales, before filing for bankruptcy in 2002.",
      "Atlantis: The Lost Tales used APC files, as did Egypt II, Odyssey: The Search For Ulysses, China: The Forbidden City, and a handful of other CRYO games. If you've encountered an APC file, it likely came from one of CRYO Interactive's video games."
