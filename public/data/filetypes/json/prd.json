      "PRD files are saved in a proprietary format and were the primary file type associated with Presentations until they were replaced by .PRDX files. They were replaced similarly to how PPT files were replaced by PPTX files in PowerPoint. Although the PRD format was replaced by PRDX, Presentations can still be used to open, edit, and save PRD files.",
      "NOTE: PRD files may be exported to various formats in Presentaions, such as .PDF , .HTML , .PNG , .JPG , .TIF , .BMP , .WMV , or .MP4 ."
