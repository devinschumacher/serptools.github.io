      "AU3 scripts are designed for automating commands within Windows and for other general scripting purposes. The A3X format enables you to compile your AU3 script into a standalone executable, which allows you to distribute smaller files that don't need to include the AutoIt3.exe file in each compiled script. A3X files can be run by an AutoIt interpreter, such as AutoIt3 or a compiled script with the AutoItExecuteAllowed flag set, or it can also be included in another script.",
      "NOTE: AutoIt uses a programming language similar to BASIC and can simulate keystrokes, mouse movement, and manipulate windows, which can automate tasks that are not possible with VBScript or SendKeys."
