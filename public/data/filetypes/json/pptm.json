      "PPTM files are similar to .PPTX files, which utilize the Open XML document format introduced in Microsoft Office 2007. However, PPTM files support embedded macros that can be executed by PowerPoint.",
      "Even if a PPTX file includes macros, PowerPoint will not allow users to run them. They must first be saved as a PPTM file, and then the macros may be executed.",
      "Macros in PowerPoint function similarly to scripts allowing you to automate repetitive tasks such as formatting a slide, adding text, or creating new slide themes. You can create and edit macros using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) by clicking Macros in the View tab in the ribbon."
