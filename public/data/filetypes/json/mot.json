      "Various industries, including TV, film, advertising, architecture, and video game development, use LightWave 3D to create 3D graphics and animations. You can add keyframes to an animation in the app to configure how the object or camera moves.",
      "When Lightwave 3D reads the keyframes stored in a MOT file, it interpolates the movement between them to create a fluid animation. To save a motion in a MOT file with LightWave 3D, select Save â†’ Save Motion File .",
      "NOTE: NewTek initially developed LightWave 3D, but LightWave Digital acquired and currently develops the software."
