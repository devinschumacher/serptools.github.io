      "Lexy's Labyrinth is an updated, open-source version of the Chip's Challenge series of games. It allows players to create and play custom levels, saved as C2M files.",
      "Players can also save groups of Lexy's Labyrinth levels as level packs. These level packs take the form of ZIP archives that contain multiple C2M files and a C2G file. The C2G file contains a list of the pack's levels, which Lexy's Labyrinth uses to correctly load and organize a level pack that is loaded using the game's load directory button."
