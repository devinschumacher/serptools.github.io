      "Pixlr is a primarily web-based suite of image editing applications that graphic designers and photographers use to create and edit images. Pixlr is similar to Adobe Photoshop, except that Pixlr's web version functions entirely within a user's web browser.",
      "If a user wants to save an in-progress Pixlr project to their PC or mobile device, they can save the project as a PXZ file. Saving the project as a PXZ file preserves the layer-based edits the user has made to the image, such as adding text, adjustments, filters, masks, and additional images. This allows the user to continue editing those layers in the future. In contrast, saving a Pixlr project as a .JPG , .PNG ., or .WEBP file flattens the image to a single layer.",
      "Each PXZ file is a Zip archive that includes all the files Pixlr uses to load and show layer-based images to users. PXZ files typically contain:",
      "Until early 2021, Pixlr saved layer-based images as PXD files. While Pixlr users can still load PXD files in Pixlr, Pixlr now saves all layer-based images in the PXZ format.",
      "NOTE: Autodesk acquired Pixlr in 2011, then Inmagine acquired Pixlr from Autodesk in 2017."
