      "Dogeminer 2 is an online game that allows players to \"mine\" Dogecoin and create an intergalactic empire. The game is free-to-play, but in-game bonuses can be purchased by joining the game's Patreon.",
      "When a player wants to save an in-progress game of Dogeminer 2, they can click the Gear icon that appears in the game's menu and then select the Download Save button. This saves a DOGE file to the player's Downloads folder, which can be used to resume their in-progress game at a later time."
