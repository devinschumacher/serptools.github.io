      "You will only encounter RCC files if you use Autodesk Recap software and have imported data gathered from a structured scan. The files can be found in the \"Support\" folder with a project created by Recap if it includes data from a structured scan. The folder may also include LLT, DIFF, RCS, and THUMBNAIL files. Structured scan data is typically collected using Leica, Faro, Riegl, Z+F, Trimble, and Topcon 3D laser scanners."
