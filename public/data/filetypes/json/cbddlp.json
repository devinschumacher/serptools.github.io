      "Chitubox is a slicer program that allows 3D printer users to arrange, edit, and slice one or more 3D models for printing. Slicing a model converts that model into a set of instructions that a 3D printer uses to print the model (by printing \"slices\" of the model atop or alongside each other, until the whole model is printed).",
      "By default, Chitubox saves sliced 3D models in the CBDDLP format. Several 3D printers with which Chitubox is packaged (such as the original Elegoo Mars and Mars Pro) can print only models saved in the CBDDLP format. Others, however, can print only models saved in Chitubox's .CTB format. (You can use Chitubox to convert sliced models from one format to the other, by following the How to convert instructions detailed below.)"
