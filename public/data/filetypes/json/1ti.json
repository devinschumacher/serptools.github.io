      "1tracker is a chiptune music tracker that allows users to create, edit, and export audio that sounds like 1-bit video game music. While creating songs, users can apply different instruments to each of those songs' included channels. Instruments modify how 1tracker plays the notes that a channel contains.",
      "To create, load, and apply instruments, users press F4 to access 1tracker's Instrument Editor. There, users can cycle between a song's included instruments and modify any instrument's Length and Threshold settings. They can then save the instrument they've created as a 1TI file (by pressing F2 ), so they can quickly import it into and apply it to other channels, including those in other 1tracker modules ( .1TM files)."
