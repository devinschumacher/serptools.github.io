      "Jason Nunn developed and released UNIS Composer 669 in 1994. Users could compose music with UNIS Composer 669 by arranging sequences of sound samples, which they played back in a loop or pattern.",
      "The 669 format is similar to the more popular .MOD format, another tracker format from the same period. While 669 files were common among music tracker enthusiasts, the 669 format is now a legacy format."
