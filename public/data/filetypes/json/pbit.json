      "The PBIT file is similar to the .PBIX file, which is the primary file type created by Power BI Desktop. However, the PBIT file is used to save queries, data models, visualizations, and reports for the purpose of being reused. You can create the PBIT file by selecting File → Save As or File → Export → Power BI Template .",
      "PBIT files are saved in the Office XML format, which is also used to save the popular .DOCX , .XLSX , and .PPTX files. If you need to manually view the contents you can rename the \".pbit\" extension to \".zip\" to create a .ZIP file and then extract the contents of the file.",
      "Power BI Desktop is a data visualization program typically used to view data for business purposes. The application allows you to import various data formats such as .CSV , XLSX, and .XML or SQL server, IBM, and Access databases. The program can also connect to a variety of online services including Google Analytics, SharePoint, and Salesforce.",
      "After connecting data sources, you can combine and shape the data and build reports. You can customize the visualizations of reports, which includes the graph type, colors, and filters. Most users will save this information in the PBIX file but you can save it as a PBIT template if you want to replicate the information."
