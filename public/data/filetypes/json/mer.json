      "RSView is a Human Machine Interface (HMI) application that allows you to develop, monitor, and control industrial automation systems. It is available in multiple versions, including RSView Studio and RSView ME (Machine Edition).",
      "After a developer creates an automation program in RSView, they can compile that program and save it as an MER file. RSView can then execute the program to perform the automation tasks it contains.",
      "NOTE: In 2021, Rockwell Automation replaced RSView with FactoryTalk."
