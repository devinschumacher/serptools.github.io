      "Microsoft Outlook is an email and calendar app available for Windows and macOS. Microsoft Outlook 15, a Mac version of Outlook released in 2014, saves local copies of users' email messages in a series of OLK15 files.",
      "For example, an email that includes body content and an attachment would have its data saved in three separate files, an OLK15MESSAGE file, an .OLK15MSGSOURCE file, and an .OLK15MSGATTACH file. Outlook 15 uses these files to load messages more quickly when a user is browsing their email.",
      "The OLK15MESSAGE file contains the email's header content, including the email's To, From, and Subject information. Outlook 15 saves OLK15MESSAGE files in the following directory:",
