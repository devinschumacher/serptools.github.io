      "You will likely only encounter a REC file if you own a Topfield PVR digital video recorder and have recorded TV programming, such as a show or movie, then transferred it from the digital video recorder to a computer. However, you may also receive a REC video file via email, USB device, or cloud storage service from someone who owns a Topfield PVR digital video recorder.",
      "NOTE: REC files are also known as Toppy files since Toppy is short for Topfield."
