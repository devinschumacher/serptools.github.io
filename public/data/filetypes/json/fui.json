      "Minecraft: Legacy Console Edition is a collective name that gamers use to refer to console-specific versions of Minecraft published by 4J Studios. These versions have since been replaced by Minecraft Bedrock Edition.",
      "4J Studios' versions of Minecraft include many types of proprietary files, including FUI files. FUI files contain images ( .PNG and .JPG files) applied as part of a game's UI. They also include data that specifies how the images are applied. For example, a FUI file contains textures that mimic a console's controls, and they contain images used as loading screen and other menu backdrops.",
      "NOTE: FUI files are stored within Minecraft: Legacy Console Edition .ARC files."
