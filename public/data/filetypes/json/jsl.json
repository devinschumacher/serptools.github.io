      "Since JSL files store scripting language in plain text format, they can be opened and edited with text editors. Some examples of programs that can be used to open and edit JSL files include Microsoft Notepad and Apple TextEdit.",
      "You most likely will only encounter a JSL file if you work in a field that requires data analysis. JMP software comes with a variety of pre-made JSL scripts that can be modified. Sample JSL scripts included with JMP can be found in the \"Scripts\" folder in the \"Samples\" folder included in the installation directory of JMP.",
      "Users can also create their own scripts from scratch. Some examples of uses of the scripts include connecting to databases to retrieve data or automating the modification of data fields in a table."
