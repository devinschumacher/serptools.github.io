      "An AUTOSAVE file is used to save a project when it has not yet been saved. They do not overwrite the current COMP file but instead are created in the same folder location as the COMP file. If the AUTOSAVE file exists in the same location as the COMP file, a dialog will appear asking if you want to load the autosaved or composition version of the project.",
