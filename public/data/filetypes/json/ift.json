      "The Turku PET Centre in Finland develops TPC programs, which help researchers study metabolism, blood flow, receptor binding, and other physiological processes using PET imaging. Examples of TPC tools include iftadd , which adds key-value pairs to an IFT file, and iftvalc , which performs arithmetic calculations on values in an IFT file.",
      "The primary function of IFT files is to store input parameters for TPC programs, allowing researchers to automate analyses and avoid manual data entry. Examples of input parameters include scan settings, region definitions, and kinetic modeling options. Additionally, IFT files may store analysis results, including computed values, statistical outputs, or modeling data, which users can later reload, review, or process further.",
      "NOTE: The \"Interfile Transfer\" name comes from \"Interfile headers,\" which store standardized metadata in PET imaging. IFT files function similarly to Interfile headers, which is why the names are similar."
