      "EPRT files are part of the eDrawings file family, along with .EDRW (2D drawings) and .EASM (3D assemblies). These formats are designed to simplify the sharing and reviewing of CAD data, especially with stakeholders who don't have access to expensive CAD tools.",
      "Users receiving EPRT files can use the free eDrawings Viewer (also known as \"eDrawings\") to view the 3D part, inspect its properties, present it, and print it. The utility is available for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android."
