      "Anki is a free program that students, professionals, and enthusiasts use to study a variety of memorization-based topics. The program lets users create and import decks of flashcards that can be used to learn languages, study for exams, memorize trivia, and even match faces to names. To help users get started, Anki provides a variety of sample APKG files on its website.",
      "APKG files store each side of a flashcard, called a \"note,\" in a format similar to a database entry. Note entries are associated with a specific flashcard using a unique ID. Flashcards can have any number of notes linked to them."
