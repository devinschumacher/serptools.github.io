      "Iomega was a tech company that specialized in producing data storage systems. One of Iomega's more popular products was the Zip drive system, which allowed users to store and load a then-large amount of data from \"superfloppy\" disks. Iomega followed up the Zip drive system with the Jaz drive system, a less-popular hard disk storage system.",
      "Iomega packaged later Zip and Jazz drive systems with Iomega Backup and Iomega Automatic Backup Pro, which were utilities that could be used to back up a disk's data to a 113 file. (Prior to Iomega Backup's release, Zip and Jaz drives included a backup utility named 1-Step Backup for Zip/Jaz. This program saved backups as .1-step files.) If the data on a user's backed-up disk became damaged or corrupted, they could use their drive's included backup utility to restore that data from the corresponding 113 file."
