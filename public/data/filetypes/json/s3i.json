      "Future Crew developed Scream Tracker, releasing the first version in the 1980s, and version 3, which introduced the S3I format, in 1994. The program allowed musicians to arrange music in a step-based format, manipulating samples for detailed control over sound production. Although Scream Tracker 3 is discontinued (Future Crew ended development after releasing 3.21), and the S3I format is largely obsolete today, some retro music enthusiasts still use S3I files when creating music."
