      "The LUA scripting language can be parsed and run by a Lua interpreter . Developers may also compile LUA files into executable binary programs using an ANSI C compiler or embed Lua scripts into existing programs, which are then compiled.",
      "Lua is used for various purposes, including scripting in applications or on the web, programming games, and adding extensions to databases. Some examples of real-world use of Lua include the customization of World of Warcraft and Dawn of War video games and the programming of the Adobe Lightroom app user interface . The scripting language was also used for game levels in the Angry Birds Mac program, which is now discontinued.",
      "NOTE: \"Lua\" comes from the Portuguese word for moon."
