      "While Sun Raster Graphics primarily use the .SUN and .RAS extensions, some are saved as SR files. You can identify a Sun Raster Graphic by opening the file in a hex editor and examining its header. A Sun Raster Graphic's header always includes the magic number 59a66a95 .",
      "SR files may contain full-color, paletted, or grayscale images, saved with an image depth of 1, 4, 8, 24, or 32 bits. The data an SR file contains may be compressed, using run-length encoding, or uncompressed."
