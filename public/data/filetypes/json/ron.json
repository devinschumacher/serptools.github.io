      "Just like JSON, Rusty Object Notation can be used to structure and transmit data. Unlike JSON files, RON files can include trailing commas and single- and multi-line comments, and they can include struct labels that group sets of data.",
      "Most often, RON files are referenced within Rust programs. To use a RON file with a Rust program, a developer must add Rusty Object Notation as a dependency and then import the RON file."
