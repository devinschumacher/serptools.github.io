      "The XDL format ensures that XML files follow a consistent structure, making it easier for programs to read, write, and validate the data. One of the most common uses of XDL files was in Microsoft InfoPath, a form design and data-gathering tool that was part of the Microsoft Office suite. In that context, XDL files defined the structure of the XML data generated by InfoPath forms, helping other systems process the form data reliably.",
      "Although XML is still used in enterprise environments, formats like JSON have become more popular in web and app development due to their simpler syntax and lighter structure. As a result, XDL files—and tools like InfoPath that depended on them—are less common today. However, in industries such as government, healthcare, or finance, where XML remains a standard, XDL and similar schema files are still used to validate and manage structured data."
