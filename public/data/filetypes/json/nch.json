      "Because the NCH file is essential to maintaining folder integrity, corrupting or modifying it can result in broken folder views or missing mail folder listings within the program. You can typically find NCH files in the Mail directory within the Outlook Express data folder. One common example is Folders.nch , which stores information about the user's folder hierarchy."
