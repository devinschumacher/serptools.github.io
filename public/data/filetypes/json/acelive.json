      "ACELIVE files are created after a broadcast is launched using the acestreamengine-stream command in ACE Stream. Clients can access the broadcast using the ACELIVE file. However, in order for a client to connect to receive a broadcast it must first connect with an authorized node that has been marked as “trustworthy” by the creator of the broadcast. The list of authorized or “trustworthy” nodes is stored in the ACELIVE file, which is why it is required to connect to a broadcast.",
      "ACELIVE files can be opened by ACE Player, which is included with the Ace Stream Media package and based on the VLC media player with BitTorrent support. They can also by opened by VLC media player and Winamp."
