      "Lancer is a TTRPG published by Massif Press. In games of Lancer, players take on the role of mech pilots and engage in various galactic adventures. To help players and gamemasters manage their Lancer characters and games, Massif Press provides a web app named COMP/CON.",
      "Digital expansions for Lancer typically include one or more LCP files. These files describe the gear, weapons, talents, and other character-related content the expansion includes. Players and gamemasters can import an expansion's LCP files into COMP/CON to use those files' contents when building characters and encounters.",
      "NOTE: LCP files are renamed .ZIP files that contain .JSON files. Each JSON file describes a portion of the content pack's contents."
