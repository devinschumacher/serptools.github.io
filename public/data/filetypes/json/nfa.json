      "The Netflix app allows Android and iOS users to download a wide variety of movies and shows for viewing when not connected to the Internet. Most titles on Netflix are available for download although some are excluded. If a title can be downloaded it has a download icon next to the name. You can search for downloadable titles by selecting \"Available for Download\" from the Netflix menu. Tap the download icon to begin the download then navigate to the \"My Downloads\" section of the app to access the downloaded movie or show.",
