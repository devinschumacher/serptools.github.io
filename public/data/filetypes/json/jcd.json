      "Jewelry designers can use JewelCAD to produce 3D prototypes of pieces of jewelry. These prototypes are saved in JCD files.",
      "After a designer has finished creating a prototype, they can export their jewelry design as an .STL file. Jewelry machining and manufacturing facilities can use the STL file to turn the designer's prototype into a real piece of jewelry."
