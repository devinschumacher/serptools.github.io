      "The HD Digital VCR Association developed the DV format in 1994, and Sony, Panasonic, and JVC spearheaded a consortium of video manufacturers that launched the format a year later. It aimed to transition from analog to digital data, offering higher video resolution and improved audio quality.",
      "Amateur and professional users widely used the DV videotape format in the 1990s and 2000s. However, with advancements in camera technology favoring memory cards, solid-state drives for video storage, and more advanced video file formats, the use of DV tapes declined rapidly in the 2010s. Additionally, magnetic tape couldn't keep up with increasing video resolutions and bitrates .",

When transferring video to a computer from a camera via Firewire , the computer may save the data in various DV file formats. Examples include:",
      "NOTE: If a DV file contains video saved in a program-specific format, programs that support DV files but not the program-specific format will likely not open it."
