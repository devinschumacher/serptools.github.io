      "Legacy Charting is an add-on to the Legacy Family Tree genealogy program. After creating a family tree in Legacy Family Tree, a user can export that tree to Legacy Charting by selecting Reports â†’ Legacy Charting . This allows the user to format the tree and print it as a wall chart.",
      "For example, a user can import a tree, choose to show the tree's contents as an hourglass chart, and then alter the chart's theme, colors, size, and background. After a user has formatted their chart to their liking, they can save it as an LWCX file. This allows them to open, edit, print, and/or email the chart again later if needed."
