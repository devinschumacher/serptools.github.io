      "Ogg is an open-source audio container format developed and maintained by the Xiph.Org Foundation. Before 2007, all Ogg audio files used the .OGG extension. In 2007, Xiph.Org began recommending that the .ogg extension be used only for Ogg Vorbis audio files (which are audio files encoded using Vorbis and saved in an Ogg container). At the same time, Xiph.org recommended that most other audio-only Ogg files be saved using the .oga extension.",
      "Because OGA files are a subset of Ogg audio files, their file type icons may include the OGG extension instead of the OGA extension. For example, the file type icon shown on this page is VideoLAN VLC media player's default icon for OGA files.",
      "NOTE: Xiph.Org has released a DirectShow codec pack that allows developers to include OGA support in open-source and commercial Windows applications."
