      "Odyemu is a Magnavox Odyssey emulator available for MS-DOS. It allows users to play Odyssey games, such as Tennis, Volleyball, and Football, on their PCs.",
      "Each Odyemu game is saved as an MO1 file. These files are text files that emulate the connections made between a real Magnavox Odyssey and a real game cartridge. Some MO1 files reference a BO1 file, which contains an overlay image used to add colors to a game. For example, the game file TENNIS.MO1 references an image named TENNIS.BO1 , which makes the game look like a green and yellow tennis court.",
      "To create BO1 files, Odyemu users use a utility named BMPTORLE . This utility accepts BMP images that are 320 x 200 pixels in size and use 8-bit color."
