      "Developers and database administrators write and manage PKB files when building Oracle database applications. The PKB file works together with the PKS file to define a complete Oracle package.",
      "While the PKS file outlines what is available to other users or applications, the PKB file provides the internal workings behind those definitions. This separation allows developers to change how features work without changing how they are accessed, making development and maintenance more flexible and secure."
