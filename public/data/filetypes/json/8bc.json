      "Photoshop users primarily encountered 8BC files during the late 1990s and early 2000s, particularly with Adobe Photoshop 5.0 and later versions of the 5.x series. During their peak usage, many designers and digital artists relied on these plugins to enhance their workflow and achieve effects not available in Photoshop by default. However, as Photoshop evolved, Adobe introduced new plugin formats, making 8BC files obsolete in later versions."
