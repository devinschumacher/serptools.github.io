      "Developer Sean Heber (aka BigZaphod) created the COW programming language in 2003. According to Heber, COW was \"designed with the bovine in mind.\" For that reason, all of COW's instructions are variations of the word moo. The language consists of twelve versions of moo, including moo , mOo , moO , mOO , Moo , MOo , MoO , MOO , OOO , MMM , OOM , and oom .",
      "Developers use these variants of moo to write COW programs in text or source code editors. Typically, developers save these programs as MOO files."
