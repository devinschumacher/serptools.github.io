      "HVIF files can be created and opened by Icon-O-Matic, which is an icon editor included with Haiku. The program can also be used to convert HVIF files to .SVG or .PNG files.",
      "The Haiku operating system (OS) was inspired by BeOS, which was an OS developed in the 1990s. The first beta of Haiku was released in September 2018. The HVIF file format was introduced to replace and improve upon .BMP icons, which were previously used by BeOS for storing icons."
