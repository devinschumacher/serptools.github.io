      "Game developers and Arduboy enthusiasts primarily use the ARDUBOY format to simplify sharing, organizing, and installing games in a single file. The packages are .ZIP archives, but are saved with an .arduboy extension instead of .zip . Game managers and loaders, such as Team A.R.G. Game Loader, read these files to display game details, show preview images, and upload the game to the device.",
      "NOTE: You can create an ARDUBOY file by placing the required files into a folder, compressing it as a ZIP archive, and renaming the extension to .arduboy ."
