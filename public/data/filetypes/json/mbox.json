      "Version 1.x of Apple Mail used MBOX files and stored them in the /​User/​Library/​Mail/​Mailboxes/​ directory. Mail 2.0 and later versions use the .EMLX format, which separates messages into individual files so they can be searched by Spotlight.",
      "However, Apple Mail still exports mailboxes as MBOX files. If you right-click a mailbox and select Export Mailbox... , Apple Mail will save that mailbox's contents as an MBOX file.",
      "NOTE: Opera Mail, which was discontinued in 2016, also stored messages in the MBOX format."
