      "FOT files are used in the process of installing \"embedded fonts\" in Windows. Embedded fonts allow fonts to be transferred between computers and require a FOT font resource file in addition to the TrueType font. The FOT file contains the information that Windows needs to recognize and install the font. The Windows API includes a function called CreateScalableFontResource that can be used for creating FOT files."
