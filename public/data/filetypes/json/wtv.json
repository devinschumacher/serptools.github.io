      "WTV files are created by the Stream Buffer Engine (SBE) when Windows Media Center records a television show. They are saved in the \\​Users\\​public\\​Recorded TV\\​ directory by default. Recorded shows can be opened and played back within Windows Media Center.",
      "The WTV file format replaced the previous .DVR-MS file format in the Windows 7 version of Windows Media Center. WTV files can be converted back into DVR-MS files by right clicking them in Windows Media Center and selecting the \"Convert to .dvr-ms Format\" option."
