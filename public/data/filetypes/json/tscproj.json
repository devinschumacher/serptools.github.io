      "Camtasia can create various types of videos, including tutorials, video game recordings, training videos, and webinar recordings. TechSmith introduced the TSCPROJ file type when it released version 9 of Camtasia for Windows, replacing the .CAMPROJ file type used by the Windows versions of Camtasia. While the macOS version of Camtasia saves projects as CMPROJ files, it can also export them as TSCPROJ files.",
      "When saving a video with the Windows version of Camtasia, the application creates a TSCPROJ project file to store the contents. After saving the TSCPROJ file, you can close it and re-open it for further editing. To create a TSCPROJ file with the Windows version of Camtasia, follow these steps: Select File → New Project or New Project From Template... if you have not yet started a project Select File → Save or Save As... Name the project, choose the save location, then click Save",
      "You can create a TSCPROJ file with the macOS version of Camtasia by selecting File → Export → Project for Windows . This workflow creates a .ZIP archive, which contains the TSCPROJ file."
