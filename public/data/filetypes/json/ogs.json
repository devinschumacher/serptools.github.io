You can access Code Builder by clicking the yellow gear icon in the standard toolbar. You can also open OGS files in Code Builder by selecting File → Open... .",
      "Another way to open OGS files is through the Script Window. To access the Script Window, select Window → Script Window and then select File(Text) → Open... in the Script Window.",
