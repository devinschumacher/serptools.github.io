      "MIDI is a widely-used connectivity standard that allows computers, hardware, and digital music programs to communicate musical information with each other. MIDI files contain information that defines a song or other piece of audio's contents. The information MIDI files contain is not actual audio. Instead, it is akin to sheet music, which can be read and played by MIDI-compliant programs and devices.",
      "NOTE: MIDI files also use the .MID file extension."
