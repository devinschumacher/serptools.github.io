      "A DSR file is used along with a .DSPL file to configure game rules of a CODMW3 dedicated server. You can open and edit the DSPL file with a text editor such as WordPad or Notepad, however, if you edit a recipe file during a session the changes will occur in the next map.",
      "NOTE: Default DSR files, such as Team Deathmatch, Drop Zone, and Domination, for the Steam version of CODMW3 are located in the Modern Warfare 3 directory in the \"admin\" folder."
