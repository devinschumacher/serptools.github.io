      "JB2 are segmented into three types of regions: text, halftone images, and generic regions. This allows the JBIG2 algorithm to optimize compression for the different areas of the image.",
      "Because of their high compression ratios, JBIG2 images are commonly used to store binary images for transmission via fax. JBIG2 files replaced the previous JBIG specification ( .JBIG files)."
