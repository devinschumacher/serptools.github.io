      "JW Library is a mobile and Windows application that allows users to import and read Jehovah's Witnesses publications on their smartphone, tablet, or PC. For example, users can download, import, and read documents saved as .JWPUB files.",
      "While reading, JW Library users can annotate documents with notes, highlighting, underlines, bookmarks, and tags. If a user wants to back up these annotations, they can do so by clicking JW Library's Cloud icon and selecting Create a backup . This saves the user's annotations as a JWLIBRARY file, which they can store on their device, send to a cloud storage service, or email to themself."
