      "Firmware controls how a hardware device communicates with other hardware devices. Periodically, hardware manufacturers may release firmware updates, which fix firmware bugs or allow a device to communicate with additional (often newer) types of devices.",
      "Sometimes, manufacturers provide firmware updates to users in the form of FW files. After receiving an FW file, users are meant to install it on an appropriate device."
