      "WBK backup files are automatically created for a Word document when you save the document, but the \"Always create backup copy\" option must be enabled in Word. This option is turned off by default but you can access the option and turn it on by following these instructions: Word 2003 - Navigate to Tools → Options → Save . Word 2007 - Select Word Options → Advanced from the Microsoft Office Button. Word 365 - Select File → More... → Options → Advanced , then scroll down to the \"Save\" section. NOTE: If a WBK file is not found on your system, there may also be an auto-save file ( .ASD ) you can load with Word to recover your document.",
