      "In 1999, the Joint Photographic Experts Group ( JPEG ) released an addition to the original JPEG standard, describing a compression format that allowed programs to save images both losslessly and near-losslessly. That compression format and its associated file format were named JPEG-LS. Notably, JPEG-LS compression allows users to control the maximum amount of data that is lost when a program compresses their image, which is what makes the lossy version of the format \"near-lossless.\"",
      "While JPEG-LS files are saved using the .jls extension, other file formats, such as .JPX and .SPIFF , also sometimes use JPEG-LS compression. JPEG-LS and JPEG, however, are different file formats, so programs that can open a .JPEG or .JPG often cannot open JLS files."
