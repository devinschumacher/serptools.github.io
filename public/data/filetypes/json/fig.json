      "MATLAB is an advanced application that provides various tools to analyze data, develop algorithms, create models, build apps, and more. In MATLAB, a figure is data visualized as a plot, such as a histogram or pie graph, output from mathematical data. Additionally, the figure function creates a figure (window), which allows you to insert plots and graphs.",
