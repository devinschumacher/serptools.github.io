      "There are several variations of the LWO format, with the first version released in 1994. NewTek released the second version (LWO2) in 2001 (LightWave 6.0).",
      "Typically, LightWave 3D users create LWO files to save 3D objects ( Save â†’ Save Current Object ). However, users may also export objects as LWO files with other apps, such as Modo and Poser.",
      "NOTE: NewTek initially developed LightWave 3D, but LightWave Digital acquired and currently develops the software."
