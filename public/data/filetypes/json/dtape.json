      "You will only encounter DTAPE files if you are browsing the installation directory of the Just Dance game in Windows. You should not move or modify the file because it will affect the playback of elements within the game.",
      "Just Dance is available for Windows, Android, iOS, and other gaming consoles, such as PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. DTAPE files are used by Just Dance on these various platforms, which is why the files include platform settings.",
      "NOTE: Just Dance is no longer available for Windows."
