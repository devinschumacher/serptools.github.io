      "Interior designers, furniture makers, and cabinet manufacturers use PRO100 to create detailed 3D layouts for kitchens, closets, offices, and other spaces. They import MEB files into PRO100 projects ( .STO files) to add catalog items to their virtual room designs, allowing for consistent furniture model reuse and speeding up the design process."
