      "Smart Launcher is an Android app that allows users to customize their home screen. For example, Smart Launcher users can create an Android home screen in which their apps are grouped by category.",
      "If a Smart Launcher user wants to back up and/or share their custom home screen with another user, they can save the screen as an SLBK file. The SLBK file contains the theme, wallpaper, icon packs, widget settings, and app page settings used on a user's home screen. It does not contain any Android application or user data (i.e. it does not contain a backup of your device's files)."
