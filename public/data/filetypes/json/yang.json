      "NETCONF is a network management protocol that was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The IETF published NETCONF's initial specifications in 2006. After developing NETCONF, the IETF determined it needed a data modeling language that could be used to define data models manipulated by NETCONF. Thus, the IETF created the YANG data modeling language.",
      "Data models written using YANG are saved as YANG files. Each YANG data model declares a namespace and a prefix before importing the YANG library module ( ietf-yang-types ). It then defines the data types, containers, lists, and leafs (items) that the data model includes."
