      "PASCO Xplorer GLX is a discontinued datalogger that students can use to record data while performing scientific experiments. For example, a student can plug an external temperature sensor into their Xplorer GLX and use it to record and graph an item's temperature during an experiment.",
      "Students can view the data they record on an Xplorer GLX either in the device itself or on a computer. To view the data on a computer, students must connect their Xplorer GLX to a computer and open or download their GLX files using GLX File Manager. GLX File Manager opens students' GLX files in PASCO DataStudio (also discontinued) or PASCO Capstone."
