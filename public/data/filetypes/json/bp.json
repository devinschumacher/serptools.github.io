      "Spaceflight Simulator is a multiplatform rocket construction and space exploration game. It allows players to build and launch rockets and then navigate to and land on planets.",
      "In versions 1.4 and below of Spaceflight Simulator, the rockets that players construct are saved as BP files, also known as Spaceflight Simulator blueprints. Players can import and export BP files to use other players' blueprints in Spaceflight Simulator.",
      "NOTE: In versions 1.5 and above of Spaceflight Simulator, BP files have been replaced by Blueprint.txt files, which are saved in rocket-specific sub-folders."
