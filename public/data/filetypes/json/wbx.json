      "Winbox is a GUI utility that those who own MikroTik routers can use to manage their router's (or routers') settings. To allow router admins to easily transfer routers' MAC addresses , IP addresses , and login credentials between computers, Winbox gives users the option to export this data in WBX files. WBX files are most useful for those who use Winbox to manage multiple routers, allowing them to import a series of router addresses and login information at once, rather than entering that information manually on many computers."
