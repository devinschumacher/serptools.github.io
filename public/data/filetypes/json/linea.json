      "Linea Sketch allows illustrators to create sketches, digital paintings, logos, and other drawings on their iPhone or iPad. It also allows illustrators to add labels, notes, and callouts to their drawings and save a timelapse video of their drawing process.",
      "The app saves illustrators' drawing projects as LINEA files. Each LINEA file contains not only the drawing's data, saved as a series of .PNG images that correspond to each of the drawing's layers, but also an associated thumbnail image, any notes added to the drawing, and the associated timelapse video (if one has been created). All these constituent files are compressed using Zip compression, to make the LINEA file easier to store and share.",
      "If an illustrator wants to view their LINEA file on a desktop computer, they can open it in Linea Link. Linea Link allows users to view, but not edit, the drawing a LINEA file contains, as well as export the drawing to other apps and file formats."
