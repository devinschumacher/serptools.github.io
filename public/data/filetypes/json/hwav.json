      "The original Nintendo 3DS hShop was an unofficial content repository popularized in the early 2020s that allowed users to download 3DS games, downloadable content (DLC), updates, and other software. Following the continued decline of official 3DS services, including the shutdown of the Nintendo eShop in March 2023, developers created 3hs as a standalone homebrew application for hacked 3DS systems running custom firmware, allowing users to install content from the new version of hShop. One of its main features is the ability to play background music while browsing the app, enhancing the user experience.",
      "Gamers typically create HWAV files by converting standard .WAV files to HWAV format using 3hsâ€™ official online HWAV generator . However, the included command-line tool, 3hstool, also supports converting other audio formats into HWAV files."
