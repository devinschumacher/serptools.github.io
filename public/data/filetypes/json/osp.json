      "OpenShot Video Editor is a non-linear video editor, which means that users can access and edit any frame in a video without destroying the original copy of the frames. The software uses FFmpeg libraries, which provide support for several different audio, video, and image formats. You can import multimedia files into an OSP project by selecting File → Import Files .",
      "When you first save a project with OpenShot Video Editor ( File → Save Project ), the software creates an OSP file to store the project information (e.g., timeline editing information, settings, and references to the locations of imported multimedia files). After saving the OSP file, you can close it and re-open it to continue editing the project without losing your progress."
