      "Galaxy Watch Studio allows you to edit every detail of the watch face. You can specify the dimensions, placement, angle, font type and size, language, and time format of the watchface. Once you are finished designing your watchface you can build it as a .TPK file then upload it to the Galaxy store.",
      "Galaxy Watch Studio was formerly known as Gear Watch Designer. GWD files created by version 1.2.0 or later of Gear Watch Designer cannot be opened by version 1.1.0 or earlier.",
      "Also, version 2.0 of Galaxy Watch Designer dropped support for Gear S, Gear Fit2, Gear Fit2 Pro, and Gear S2 watches. You will need to use version 1.6.2 of Galaxy Watch Designer or earlier to support these models."
