      "SITX archives support long filenames, UNIX (macOS) and Windows file permissions, and built-in error correction, which helps recover data from transmission errors. They also offer password protection with 512-bit RC4 encryption and other encryption methods like AES, DES, and Blowfish. Starting with StuffIt 9, the format also includes JPEG compression, reducing image file sizes by 15â€“30% without losing quality.",
      "NOTE: Initially developed by Aladdin Systems (later Allume Systems), Smith Micro now maintains StuffIt. While Mac users commonly used SITX archives in the 2000s, they have become less common as .ZIP and other modern compression formats gained popularity."
