      "SFD files can be converted to .MPG files using a utility called sfd2mpg, which is part of the SFD Tool Pack by SWAT. However, this utility was not widely distributed and no longer is under development. SFD files can be created using Sega's Movie Creator application, but it is also no longer being developed and was last released in 1999. The SFD Tool Pack by SWAT includes this program.",
      "NOTE: Pro Evolution Soccer 2012 (PES 2012) SFD files can be converted to the .MPG format using the discontinued PES Video & Audio Converter."
