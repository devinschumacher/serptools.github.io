      "MPEG-DASH is an adaptive bitrate streaming technique that allows users to stream high-quality video over the Internet using HTTP . Videos streamed using MPEG-DASH are divided into segments, which are made available at a variety of different bit rates. By dividing videos into segments and making those segments available at different bit rates, web clients can stream long videos smoothly without stalling or re-buffering.",
      "When a user downloads a video streamed using MPEG-DASH, that video is saved as a series of M4S files. Each M4S file contains a specific segment of the streamed video. For example, a user who downloads a streamed YouTube video using youtube-dl may see the video saved as a series of M4S files.",
      "NOTE: M4S files often do not contain audio data."
