      "The Asura Engine is a video game development engine created by Rebellion Developments. Many games published by Rebellion and other publishers, such as Electronic Arts, LucasArts, and Sierra Entertainment, have been developed using the Asura Engine.",
      "Asura Engine games often store some of their game assets in ASR archives. While most players will never encounter or need to open a game's ASR files, modders may be interested in expanding ASR archives, extracting the assets they contain, and modifying them.",
      "NOTE: ASR files most commonly contain audio assets, such as in-game music and sound effects."
