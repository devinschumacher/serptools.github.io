      "The Cerber virus is highly dangerous malware . It is often referred to as ransomware, where the purpose of the virus is to take your files hostage and force you to pay bitcoins to the perpetrator in order to decrypt your files. The virus is a trojan horse that is commonly spread through spam emails that include infected attachments or malicious links. Once the virus affects your computer it begins scrambling your files, renaming them, and encrypting them. When encrypting your files, the virus creates .TXT , .HTML , and .VBS files that contain instructions for paying the criminals. These files are placed in each folder that contains CERBER files."
