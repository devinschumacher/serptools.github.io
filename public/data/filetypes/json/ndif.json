      "The dual fork content makes NDIF files difficult for use in cross-platform environments. The NDIF format was replaced by Apple's UDIF format, which stores data in a single-fork format. NDIF files are not widely used anymore.",
      "NOTE: NDIF files can be opened using Disk Utility, a disk image mounting program included with Mac OS X."
