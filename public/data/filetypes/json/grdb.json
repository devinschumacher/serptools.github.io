      "GRDB files are created to store databases and backup of databases of family information entered by the user. They are saved in the GRDB format, which was introduced in GRAMPS 2.0 as a solution to load/ save time and memory usage issues. However, the format was susceptible to data corruption and was replaced by the GPKG database format in 2008 with the release of GRAMPS 3.0.",
      "NOTE: Gramps was formerly known as GRAMPS, an acronym that stands for Genealogical Research and Analysis Management Programming System."
