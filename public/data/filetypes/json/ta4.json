      "The TA4 file is most often created during 2015 since annual tax returns are filed for the previous year. You can import a TA4 file for filing your 2015 taxes as it allows you to import previous tax information. Be aware that when you import a TA4 tax return into TaxAct, any data that has been entered will be overwritten by the data from the TA4 file.",
      "A TA4 file can be saved by the desktop version of TaxAct or exported from TaxAct Online. Once you have completed a tax return, you can either print and mail the tax forms or file electronically."
