      "Quake III Arena is the third entry in id Software's popular Quake video game series. It was released in 1999. Notably, Quake III did not include a single-player story mode and focused exclusively on multiplayer (or player vs. bot) gameplay.",
      "While playing Quake III, players could record their gameplay using the /record and /stoprecord console commands. Version 1.32 of Quake III saved players' recordings as DM_68 files. Players could then use the Demos menu or /demo console command to play the demos they'd recorded.",
      "NOTE: Other versions of Quake III save demos as .DM3 , .dm_48 , .dm_66 , or .dm_67 files."
