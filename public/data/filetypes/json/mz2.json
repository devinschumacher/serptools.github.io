      "ValuSoft MasterCook is a virtual cookbook program that chefs and cooks use to create, save, and share recipes. The Windows version of MasterCook saves users' recipes in MZ2 files, which are XML-like files that store the ingredients and steps needed to create a meal.",
      "Other than being used to show recipes in the desktop version of MasterCook, MZ2 files are most often used to export and upload recipes to MasterCook.com. To export an MZ2 recipe from the desktop version of MasterCook, select File â†’ Export and Mail from the program's menu bar. After you upload your MZ2 file to MasterCook.com, it will also be available in the mobile versions of MasterCook.",
      "NOTE: The MZ2 file format is used in MasterCook 14 and above. Earlier versions of MasterCook saved recipes in MX2 files."
