      "Open Data Kit is a free, open-source toolkit that allows developers to create forms and gather data using Android devices. Typically, developers create ODK forms using either XLSForm or ODK Build. Forms created using ODK Build are saved as ODKBUILD files.",
      "When viewed in ODK Build, an ODKBUILD file looks like a series of blocks describing form fields. When you select a block, the corresponding field's properties appear in ODK Build's Properties sidebar.",
      "You can add new fields to an ODK Build form by selecting the appropriate field type from the Add new menu that appears at the bottom of ODK Build. You can delete a field by selecting the X that appears in the upper right-hand corner of that field. You can also export the form an ODKBUILD file describes as an .XML or .XLSX file."
