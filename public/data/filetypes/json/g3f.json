      "Zetafax is a fax server software that allows businesses to fax documents to computers, fax machines, and other devices both within and outside their own network. When you fax or receive a document using Zetafax, the program saves a copy of the faxed document as a TIFF image. That image is stored within a G3F or G3N file.",
      "A G3F file contains a fine resolution (less compressed ) copy of a faxed document, while a G3N file contains a normal resolution (more compressed) copy of the document. Zetafax creates either a G3F or G3N file to archive your faxed document, depending on whether you chose to fax or receive the document in fine or normal resolution.",
      "G3F and G3N files are stored in the directories you use to archive faxes sent and received using Zetafax. By default, these directories are C:/​Program Files/​Zetafax Server/​Server/​Z-Sent and C:/​Program Files/​Zetafax Server/​Server/​Z-Recd ."
