      "GAME files are used for uploading GameSalad projects to the GameSalad website, which converts the file into an Xcode project ( .XCODEPROJ ). Since Apple requires that apps be submitted using Xcode, this is a necessary step before developers can submit GameSalad apps to the iTunes or Mac app stores. GAME files themselves cannot be run, and are only used for conversion to Xcode.",
