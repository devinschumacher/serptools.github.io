      "CPCAM is the North American division of Taiwanese closed-circuit television (CCTV) manufacturer AVTECH. Headquartered in Canada, CPCAM offers a variety of CCTV cameras and systems, some of which saved footage in VSR files. Notably, CPD57X and CPD50X series CCTV systems saved footage as VSR files. Modern CPCAM systems do not save footage as VSR files."
