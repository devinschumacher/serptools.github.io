      "Bome MIDI Translator allows you to map keystrokes and MIDI controls to control apps on your computer solely through a MIDI controller. This functionality is helpful to various types of users, including musicians, lighting engineers, theaters, and DJs.",
      "When using the software, you can create mappings between the MIDI controller and specific functions on your computer, then save the project as a BMTP file. After saving your progress, you can close the project and then reopen it for further modification."
