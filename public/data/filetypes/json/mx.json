      "Mathematica packages can be created using DumpSave and read using Get . They can also be imported using the Import command and exported using the Export command. For example, Import[\"myFile.mx\"] reads the MX file and returns an expression. Similarly, Export[\"myFile.mx\", expr] serializes the \"expr\" expression and saves it to an MX file.",
      "Since MX files are saved in a binary format, they are non-human readable. Additionally, they cannot be shared between different versions of Mathematica or between installations of Mathematica on different operating systems."
