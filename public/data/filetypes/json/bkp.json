      "Programs usually store BKP files alongside the data they're backing up or in a backup-specific directory (e.g., Backups or Backup ). In most cases, BKP files have filenames similar to the files for which they are a backup. For example, a BKP file created from database.db would likely be named database.db.bkp or database.bkp ."
