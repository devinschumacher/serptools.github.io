      "DAZIP files can be created using the Dragon Age Toolset, a utility published by EA that can be downloaded from the Dragon Age website. With this utility, you can add new 3D environments and quests, voice and lip syncing sounds, and cinematic sequences. You can also modify the artificial intelligence of creatures for combat scenarios.",
      "To install a DAZIP file, you can either 1) double-click the file if the DAUpdater program is associated with the DAZIP file type, or 2) navigate to the bin_ship directory of a Dragon Age: Origins installation, and run DAUpdater.exe manually.",
      "NOTE: Since DAZIP files are stored in a .ZIP format, they can be extracted using any Zip decompression utility."
