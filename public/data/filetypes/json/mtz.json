      "MIUI is a variant of the Android operating system used by Xiaomi smartphones. Among other things, MIUI allows users to customize the operating system's skin , using themes saved as MTZ files.",
      "Typically, users download and install themes via Xiamoi Themes (also known as MIUI Theme APP), and never directly interact with MTZ files. However, advanced users sometimes download MTZ files from the internet or other unofficial sources, and then manually install them via Xiaomi Themes or other MIUI theme-related applications.",
      "NOTE: MIUI stores MTZ files in subdirectories of the /​system/​media/​theme directory."
