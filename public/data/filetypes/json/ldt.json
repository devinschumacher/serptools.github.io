      "Each LDT file contains plain text data that defines a luminaire's features. This data is saved in the Elumudat format, which was created by DIAL for use in DIALux. Lighting designers can import LDT files into DIALux to include them in lighting plans for homes, office buildings, neighborhoods, commercial sites, and other environments.",
      "Typically, lighting professionals and others create LDT files using LDT Editor, a free LDT file creator also provided by DIAL."
