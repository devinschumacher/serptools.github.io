      "InstallForge is a free program developers can use to package an application within a Windows installer. By packaging their application in an installer, developers make it easier for users to install the application.",
      "While creating an installer in InstallForge, developers can specify many different settings, including their installer's language(s), GUI appearance, and compression algorithm. Developers can also add custom tasks to the install process and set their installer to create a corresponding uninstaller.",
      "InstallForge saves all these install settings in an IFP project file. Developers can open and edit their IFP file at any time, to change how their installer installs their application."
