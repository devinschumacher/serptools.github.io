      "If you do not have a web-connected computer, you can download OMS files from the HP Media Solutions Locator webpage. Here you can choose from a variety of OMS files for your printer model and substrate brand and type. Once you download the OMS file you can import the file into your printer. To do this, your computer and printer must be connected to the same LAN .",
      "If you have a web-connected printer you can search, download, and install OMS files directly through the printer's touchscreen.",
      "NOTE: Since OMS files are downloaded from the Internet you may come across the file in your downloads folder."
