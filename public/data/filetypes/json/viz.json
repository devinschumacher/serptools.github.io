      "The Avee Music Player allows Android users to listen to various audio and video formats and provides a customizable audio visualizer that changes with the audio being played. VIZ files are used to store information about the appearance of the audio visualizer. The app comes with pre-made templates, but users can also create and distribute VIZ files that store visualizer templates.",
      "You most likely will only encounter a VIZ file if you are attempting to add a template downloaded from the Internet to Avee Music Player. VIZ files are often compressed with other VIZ files in .ZIP archives to reduce the overall size of the templates. A Zip-decompression utility in Android, such as RAR or WinZip, can be used to extract VIZ files from the ZIP archive. The templates can then be installed in Avee Music Player."
