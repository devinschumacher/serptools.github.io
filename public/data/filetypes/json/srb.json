      "Most users will not encounter SRB files since they are used for storing resources and are not meant to be directly opened in the game. However, users looking to modify gameplay may see SRB files and open them in SLADE and XWE.",
      "Keep in mind that Sonic Robo Blast 2 hash checks resource files to verify their legitimacy. If a user modifies the SRB file, the game will stop due to an error.",
      "When starting the Sonic Robo Blast 2 game, the SRB file is the first game resource file loaded. It is the main game resource file and is saved in the .WAD (Where's All the Data?) format, which is a data library used by games that run on the Doom engine. Sonic Robo Blast 2 was built using a variation of the Doom Legacy port of Doom.",
      "NOTE: SRB files were replaced by ZDoom Package .PK3 files with the release of version 2.2 of Sonic Robo Blast 2."
