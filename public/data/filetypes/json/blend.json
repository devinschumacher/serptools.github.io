      "Blender is a free, multiplatform application for creating various 3D productions, including models and animations. When saving the 3D image or animation you created in Blender, the application generates a BLEND file to store its contents. After saving the BLEND file, you can close the file, then re-open it for further editing.",
      "Unlike many other types of project files, BLEND files contain all the objects, sounds, images, effects, scenes, and other assets included in a Blender project. If you want to share a Blender project with another user, you need only provide them with that project's BLEND file, not any of the assets you imported into the project.",
      "NOTE: BLEND files are saved in a proprietary binary format to keep them from growing to an unmanageable size."
