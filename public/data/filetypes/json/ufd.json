      "Cellebrite publishes programs that allow law enforcement professionals to extract, analyze, and share investigation-related data. For example, a digital forensics investigator can use Cellebrite Physical Analyzer to extract data from a suspect's smartphone, compile the contents of that data into a report ( .UFDR file), and share the report with other departments.",
      "Both Cellebrite Physical Analyzer and UFED (Universal Forensic Extraction Device) save all the data extracted from a device in a single UFD file. Investigators can then load this file and analyze the data it contains while building a case in Physical Analyzer. Optionally, investigators can save multiple extractions in a .UFDX file, to make it easier to load all the extractions at once in Physical Analyzer."
