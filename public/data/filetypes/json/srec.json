      "Motorola developed the S-record format in the 1970s for use with the Motorola 6800 microprocessor. Developers creating executable programs for the 6800 could convert those programs' source code to the S-record format. They could then flash the S-record, or SREC, file to a microprocessor to install the program it contained.",
      "Each SREC file contains a series of ASCII text records, each of which begins with the letter S (which stands for Start-of-Record). The records also consist of type, byte count, address, data, and checksum information. Each record is listed on its own line, to make SREC files easier to parse (for both humans and machines)."
