      "Adobe developed the ICAP format for when InCopy and InDesign users work collaboratively via ICMA assignment files but do not have access to a common server where the ICMA files are stored. The users may not have the correct permissions, access to the Internet, etc.",
      "An InDesign user can create and distribute an ICAP package that stores the ICMA assignment files to an InCopy user. The InCopy user can then edit it with InCopy, re-package it as an .IDAP file, and send it back to the InDesign user to import it into the original .INDD document using InDesign.",
      "To create an ICAP file with InDesign:",
      "NOTE: ICAP files are used by InCopy and InDesign CS4 and later. Previous versions used the .INCP extension."
