      "GLSL is a high-level shading language with syntax similar to the C programming language. The Open Graphics Library ( OpenGL ) uses VERT and .FRAG shaders to render 2D and 3D graphics in many different applications. For example, Minecraft, Adobe After Effects, Blender, and Avogadro all use OpenGL to render graphics.",
      "Shaders add depth to 3D graphics by altering their appearance. A shader might alter a graphic's color, light, darkness, hue, saturation, or contrast. For example, a shader might adjust the angle at which a light source hits a point, altering how an object is lit.",
      "Shaders run on a computer's graphics processing unit ( GPU ), not its central processing unit ( CPU ). This allows the CPU to focus on executing application code, instead of rendering graphics.",
      "There are two prominent types of GLSL shaders:"
