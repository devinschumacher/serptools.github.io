      "Primarily, AntiMicro and AntiMicroX allow gamers to use gamepads to play PC video games that do not include gamepad support. To do so, users create an AntiMicro profile, or AMGP file, that contains settings that map gamepad buttons to keyboard and mouse buttons.",
      "Typically, each AntiMicro profile contains settings for a specific game. For example, a gamer might create a profile that allows them to play Doom 3 with a gamepad, rather than their keyboard and mouse. The gamer could then run AntiMicro or AntiMicroX, load their Doom 3-specific profile, and use it to play Doom 3 with their gamepad.",
      "While creating an AntiMicro profile, users can also map scripts and macros to gamepad buttons. This allows users to automate and perform complex actions just by pressing one or more gamepad buttons.",
      "NOTE: Several template AMGP files are available on AntiMicroX's GitHub page ."
