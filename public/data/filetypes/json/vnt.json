      "The contents of a VNT file can be viewed in a standard text editor. However, the message may be encoded using one of several encoding methods. For example, some VNT files are encoded with quoted-printable, or \"QP\" encoding. This encodes each character with an equal sign, followed by two hexadecimal digits (for example \"=20\" represents a space). Therefore, it may be difficult to interpret the text without a QP decoder."
