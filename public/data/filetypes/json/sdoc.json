      "Samsung Notes is a note-taking app installed on some Samsung smartphones, such as the Samsung Galaxy Note and S7, and other devices. Before 2020, when a user saved a note in Samsung Notes, the note was saved as an SDOC file. Contrary to what you might expect, SDOC files are not text files. Instead, they are Zip-compressed archives that contain the text, image, and other files that make up a note.",
      "In 2020, Samsung replaced the SDOC format with the .SDOCX format. Now, when users open SDOC files in Samsung Notes, the app automatically converts those files into SDOCX files. Users can also manually convert their SDOC files to SDOCX files using the Old format notes â†’ Convert option available in Samsung Notes' settings menu."
