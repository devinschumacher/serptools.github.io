      "Lotus Software released Lotus 1-2-3 in 1983 to wide acclaim among business and home users and became one of the most used spreadsheet applications in the 1980s. However, it declined in usage in the 1990s and 2000s due to stiff competition from other applications, most notably, Microsoft Excel . IBM eventually ceased developing Lotus 1-2-3 in 2013.",
      "When creating and saving spreadsheets with version 1 of Lotus 1-2-3, the application created WKS files to store the spreadsheet's contents. Version 2 of Lotus 1-2-3 used .WK1 files to store spreadsheets, by default, version 3 used .WK3 files, and version 4 used .WK4 files.",
      "The WKS file type is a working file, which means you can save the spreadsheet, close it, then re-open it for further editing. You can save various types of spreadsheets as WKS files with Lotus 1-2-3, including corporate budgets, retirement finances, and company profits."
