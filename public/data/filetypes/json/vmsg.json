      "In 2011, Microsoft and Nokia partnered to release the Microsoft Lumia line of smartphones. These phones ran the Windows Phone and Windows 10 Mobile operating systems. Microsoft discontinued the Lumia in 2017.",
      "Lumia users could use the Transfer My Data app to back up their phone's data and transfer it to another Lumia. Transfer My Data saved backups of users' text messages as VMSG files.",
      "NOTE: Some other smartphones, such as OPPO brand phones, and apps, such as SMS EasyExporter, can also save a copy of users' text messages in the VMSG format."
