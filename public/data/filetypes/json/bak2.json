      "There are several different uses of the \"bak2\" file extension. It may be created to represent the number of backup versions for a file. The \"bak2\" extension would represent the second backup version of the file. Other programs, such as Crysis, use the \"bak2\" extension to backup a BAK file that backs up .CRY map level files. If your CRY file is corrupt, you can replace it by renaming the \"bak2\" extension of your file to \"cry.\""
