      "When a player finishes a game in TETR.IO, they can click the download button that appears beneath their final time to save their game stats and a replay of that game. TETR.IO saves the stats and replay locally as a TTR file, named replay.ttr .",
      "Each TTR file contains JSON-formatted plain text data. This data specifies the user who played the game the replay was created from, the game's seed, the game's settings, and the inputs made during the game."
