      "BlackBerry devices allow users to encrypt the files stored on their SD (also known as media) card. When a user chooses to encrypt their files, the device creates a file named info.mkf , which contains the encryption key used to encrypt the files.",
      "Most BlackBerry users will never encounter or need to use info.mkf . Digital forensics professionals sometimes use info.mkf to recover a BlackBerry device's password (if the associated SD card's encryption was set to either Security Password or Device Password) and the files stored on an SD card."
