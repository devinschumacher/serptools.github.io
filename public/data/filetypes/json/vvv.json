      "VVV (Virtual Volumes View) allows you to catalog removable volumes and archive files and folders from a local computer. When you catalog a volume, the program creates the VVV file to store the volume's contents.",
      "You can also use VVV (Virtual Volumes View) to search the volume's contents in the VVV file. For example, you can search the metadata in the folder to locate items in a specific folder in a volume."
