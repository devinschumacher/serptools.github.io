      "The XLL file type was introduced in 1996 with the release of Microsoft Excel 97. It is saved in the same format as the Dynamic Link Library ( .DLL ) file type but is renamed with the .xll file extension to indicate its association with Excel.",
      "XLL files are similar to .XLA and .XLAM add-in files in that they both provide functionality that extends the capabilities of Excel. However, XLA and XLAM files are written in the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming language and XLL files are written in the C/C++ programming language. While Microsoft develops some add-ins, third-party software developers developed most of them."
