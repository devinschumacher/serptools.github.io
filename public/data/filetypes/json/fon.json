      "FON files are .EXE files that have been renamed to use the .fon extension. Instead of containing an executable program, a FON file contains bitmapped or stroked fonts saved as FNT files. Various programs that use Windows fonts reference the default FON file included with the operating system .",
      "Notably, the fonts contained within a FON file cannot be resized like TrueType ( .TTF ) fonts. So, you may find several similar yet differently-sized fonts within a FON file. This is one of several reasons why TrueType fonts replaced FON- and FNT-based fonts."
