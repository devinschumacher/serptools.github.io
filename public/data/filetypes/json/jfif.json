      "The JFIF format defines a number of details that had been left undefined in the initial JPEG format. Defining these details, including a standard header, resolution and aspect ratio, and color model, allowed users to actually save and share files using JPEG compression.",
      "For a long time, many digital cameras saved images in the JFIF format. But over time, additional improvements to the JPEG format rendered the JFIF format mostly obsolete.",
      "NOTE: Some Windows 10 updates can cause web browsers, such as Microsoft Edge, to mistakenly save .JPG files as JFIF files. To fix this issue, you must revert your Windows Registry to saving JPEG images as .jpg files."
