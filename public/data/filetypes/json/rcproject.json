      "You will most likely only encounter an RCPROJECT file if you are a developer creating 3D objects or scenes for a website or an application with Apple Reality Composer. After finishing their 3D scene or model, developers may export the project as a .USDZ or .REALITY 3D model that can be visualized with apps and websites that utilize AR technology.",
      "The USDZ and Reality formats are supported by various types of apps, including games, educational tools, e-commerce websites, and data visualization programs. For example, an e-commerce website may enable users to view a 3D model of a dining table exported from an RCPROJECT file in their dining room through augmented reality technology on their mobile devices.",
      "NOTE: Reality Composer enables users to create, edit, save, open, and export RCPROJECT files. It is available for iOS and iPadOS and is bundled with Apple Xcode 11 for macOS."
