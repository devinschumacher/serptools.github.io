      "Efficient Diary is a Windows program that allows users to keep a password-protected diary. When a user first launches Efficient Diary, the program creates a file named MyDiary.edfw . This is a user's default diary. Users can also create custom diary files, which are saved as EDFW files.",
      "EDFW files can contain text, images, tables, and attachments. Users can also store EDFW files on Efficient Diary's cloud server, if they do not want to store their diary on their computer.",
      "NOTE: Efficient Software discontinued the Efficient Diary application."
