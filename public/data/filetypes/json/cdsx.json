      "ConceptDraw DIAGRAM is a technical drawing application for Windows and macOS that allows amateur and professional users to diagram simple and complex processes. For example, you may create a simple diagram outlining the steps for babysitting or a complex flowchart for how people receive information via mass media.",
      "CDSX files are similar to the more common .CDS file type, but contain information in the easier-to-read XML format instead of binary format, making it more convenient to transfer template information. Additionally, ConceptDraw DIAGRAM uses \"x\" at the end of the file extension, e.g., .CDX for .CDD , to signify the XML version."
