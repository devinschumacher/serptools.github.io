      "David Given developed WordGrinder as a no-frills word processor for users focused on composing text, such as novelists and other writers. Besides its support for basic styles, it includes a spellchecker, undo and redo capabilities, and autosave functionality. Additionally, you can only navigate an open WG file in WordGrinder using arrow keys.",
      "You can create a WG file via WordGrinder's menu, which is accessible by typing the \"Escape\" key. You can then use the arrow keys to select File → New document set , modify the document, access the menu again and select File → Save document set . Additionally, you can select File → Save as template... if you want to save the document as a template WG file (same format as the document set)."
