      "The DFTI file is the main file type associated with FlexiWrite. It is created when you save your document and can be closed and opened at a later time. FlexiWrite uses the document similarly to how Word uses the .DOCX and .DOC files.",
      "FlexiWrite is available to download for free as a native application for Macs. A Java archive ( .JAR ) version is available for Windows."
