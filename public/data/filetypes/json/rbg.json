      "ROBOTC is an educational programming platform that allows students to create programs for VEX Robotics, LEGO MINDSTORMS, and Arduino devices. The ROBOTC platform includes both graphical (block-based) and text-based programming interfaces. Graphical ROBOTC saves developers' programs as RBG files. (The text-based version of ROBOTC primarily saves developers' programs as .C files.)",
      "Developers use slightly-different versions of Graphical ROBOTC to create programs for different subsets of devices. For example, the version of Graphical ROBOTC used to create Arduino programs is different from the version used to create VEX Robotics programs. As such, the RBG files each version of Graphical ROBOTC produces are also slightly different. You can determine what type of device an RBG program was created for by opening the file in a text editor (such as Microsoft Notepad ) and looking for identifying information, such as VexIQ ."
