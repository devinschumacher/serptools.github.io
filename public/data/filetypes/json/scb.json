      "SCB files allow users to enter the Product Key for Euro Truck Simulator 2 when they do not have access to the Internet. SCB files are created by the program when a user enters their Product Key and attempts to activate the program but the computer cannot reach the Euro Truck Simulator 2 activation servers. The SCB file is created and named activation.scb , then placed in the \"Euro Truck Simulator 2\" folder in the \"Documents\" folder.",
      "Users can transfer the SCB file to another computer via a storage device, such as a USB flash drive or CD, then upload it to the Euro Truck Simulator 2 activation page. If the page is unavailable, the user can also email the file to Euro Truck Simulator 2.",
      "NOTE: Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a vehicle simulation game in which players drive across Europe delivering important cargo."
