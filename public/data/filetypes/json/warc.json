      "The Web ARChive, or WARC, format is an extension of the Internet Archive .ARC format. The primary difference between WARC and ARC files is that WARC files can include metadata about when and how the data they contain was archived (e.g., what program created the archive).",
      "WARC is the standard format in which internet archivists save archived webpages. However, you may encounter web archives saved in other formats, including the ARC and .WACZ formats.",
      "NOTE: WARC files compressed with gzip compression use the .warc.gz extension."
