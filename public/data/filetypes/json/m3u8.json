      "In addition to file paths and URLs, M3U8 files contain metadata that media players use to play the referenced media files correctly. For example, M3U8 files used to stream videos that are hosted online may contain information about the referenced videos' resolution, codec , and maximum needed bandwidth. This information is specified using the #EXT-X-STREAM-INF: setting.",
      "In contrast, M3U8 files used to play audio and video located on your computer are often much simpler. These files may contain only a couple pieces of metadata, such as the playlist title (specified using the #PLAYLIST setting) and track information (specified using the #EXTINF setting).",
      "NOTE: M3U8 files are similar to .M3U files, except the text they contain is always encoded using UTF-8 character encoding . On rare occasions, M3U8 files may be saved with the .M3UP extension."
