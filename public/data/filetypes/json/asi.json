      "Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Red Dead Redemption (RDR) are popular video game series published by Rockstar Games. These series enjoy a healthy modding community, which creates and shares mods that players can use to alter the games' gameplay.",
      "Mods for the Windows version of GTA IV, GTA V, and RDR 2 are often saved and distributed as ASI files. For example, GTA V players can find and download many ASI files from the website gta5-mods.com . To use these files, players must first add a related, player-created ScriptHook library to the associated game's installation directory."
