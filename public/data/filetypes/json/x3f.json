      "SIGMA is a developer of high-end digital cameras. The X3F format is supported by several SIGMA cameras that use the Foveon X3 sensor, including the SD series SLR cameras and the DP series compact cameras.",
      "X3F files can be opened by several programs, which include SIGMA Photo Pro, Corel PaintShop Pro, and CyberLink PhotoDirector. Adobe Photoshop can also open X3F files but may not support X3F files created by newer models of SIGMA cameras, such as the dp Quattro series cameras."
