      "You will most likely only encounter SUNVOX files if you use SunVox to create electronic music with synthesizers. When you begin a new project and save it with SunVox, a SUNVOX file is created to store the contents of the project. You can edit the project in the file with SunVox, save it, close it, then reopen it for further editing.",
      "SUNVOX files are only supported by the SunVox application, which is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. However, when you are finished modifying your track stored in the SUNVOX file you can export it to a more widely supported format, such as WAVE or MIDI ."
