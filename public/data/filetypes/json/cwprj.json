      "Brother CanvasWorkspace is a free program that allows sewing and embroidery enthusiasts to design patterns for use with Brother cutting machines, such as the DC200, CM650W, SDX225, and many others. If a user wants to save a finished or in-progress CanvasWorkspace project, they can do so by selecting File → Save or Save As... from the program's menu bar. CanvasWorkspace then saves the user's project as a CWPRJ file.",
      "CWPRJ files cannot be transferred to Brother cutting machines. To transfer the design a CWPRJ file contains to a Brother cutting machine, you must first save the design as an .FCM file. You can then transfer the FCM file to your cutting machine.",
      "To save a design as an FCM file, select File → Export FCM file... from CanvasWorkspace's menu bar. Then, choose the save location, name the file, and click Save ."
