      "Most Unix-based operating systems include a system manual divided into eight numbered sections. The fourth section of this manual typically includes documentation related to special files and device drivers . Most notably, this section contains documentation related to device-related files found in the /​dev/​ directory. 4 files are named for the file or driver they describe.",
      "In some Unix systems, such as System V, 4 files instead contain documentation of file formats and conventions. These 4 files can still be accessed using the man utility.",
      "NOTE: Other sections' Unix man pages use the .1 , .2 , .3 , .5 , .6 , .7 , and .8 extensions. Man pages are also commonly compressed into .GZ files (which may use the .gz.# extension)."
