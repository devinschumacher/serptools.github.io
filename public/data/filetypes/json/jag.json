      "You most likely will only encounter a JAG file if you are looking to play an Atari Jaguar game on your computer or mobile device using an emulator. Atari Jaguar games may also be dumped to .J64 files.",
      "NOTE: The Atari Jaguar was a 64-bit video game console released in 1993. It was a commercial failure and helped put Atari out of the home video game console market. However, the console has since gained a cult following, which has led to the rise in emulators supporting Atari Jaguar games."
