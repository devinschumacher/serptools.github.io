      "TensorFlow Lite is a lightweight version of TensorFlow's machine learning platform, designed for use on mobile, embedded, and edge devices. While both TensorFlow Lite and TensorFlow use machine learning models, the models they use are saved in different formats. TensorFlow Lite models are saved in the TFLITE format, which includes optimizations that reduce a model's size with little to no effect on accuracy.",
      "To create a TFLITE file, developers can use:",
      "Several example TFLITE files are available for download from TensorFlow's website and GitHub page.",
      "NOTE: By default, TFLITE files created using TensorFlow Model Maker contain metadata , while TFLITE files created using TensorFlow Lite Converter do not."
