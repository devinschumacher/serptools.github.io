      "Man pages contain documentation for system-level features of a Unix-based operating system. The pages are typically grouped into eight sections, each of which contains documentation for a subset of system information.",
      "The third man page section describes library functions that can be used in the operating system . In particular, these sections describe C library functions.",
      "For example, the file attr_get.3 contains documentation related to the attr_get and attr_getf library functions. It includes a quick synopsis of how to use the functions, a detailed description of the functions, and additional information.",
      "NOTE: Other sections' Unix man pages use the .1 , .2 , .4 , .5 , .6 , .7 , and .8 extensions. Man pages are also commonly compressed into .GZ files (which may use the .gz.# extension)."
