      "You most likely will only encounter an SIMG file if you use SynclavierX software. However, SynclavierX has been discontinued and SIMG files are no longer used, making them uncommon.",
      "NOTE: SynclavierX is a program that emulates the capabilities of a Synclavier digital synthesizer, which was a physical music workstation manufactured from the 1970s to the 1990s."
