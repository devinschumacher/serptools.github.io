      "FreeSpace 2 is a sequel to Descent: FreeSpace - The Great War. It was developed by Volition and published by Interplay Entertainment in 1999. In the game, players play as a pilot who engages in a series of space combat missions.",
      "The settings that define these missions are saved in FS2 files. Volition provided FreeSpace 2 players with an FS2 editor, named FRED2, that could be used to create custom missions. In 2002, Volition released FreeSpace 2's source code, which allowed players to create an updated version of the game named FreeSpace Open (FSO). FSO also includes an FS2 editor, named FRED2_Open."
