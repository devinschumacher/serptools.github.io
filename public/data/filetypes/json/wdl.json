      "Worldox is a document management system that businesses use to organize and control access to documents and other files. If a user wants to link multiple files together in Worldox, they can do so by adding the files to a Worldox project. They can then save the project as a WDL file and access that file in Worldox just as they would any other controlled file.",
      "When you open a WDL file in Worldox, the program shows a list of the files the WDL file links to. Users can search for, open, and edit WDL files just as they would any other Worldox document or file."
