      "Ensoniq released the EPS in 1988 and continued manufacturing it until 1991. The keyboard featured a floppy drive where users could insert floppy disks to add sounds, presets, and songs to the sampler.",
      "While the sampler is no longer in production, music enthusiasts looking to access the sounds stored on floppy disks dump the data and save them in the EDE format. They then play the EDE files or convert them to other file types with software."
