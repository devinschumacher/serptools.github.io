      "UCF files contain embedded rich media content created by other programs. Users must have an appropriate program to display the contents. For example, a UCF file that contains .WMV content can be viewed with Windows Media Player.",
      "To verify that meeting attendees can view UCF files, choose the \"Request that attendees verify rich media players\" option when scheduling a meeting in WebEx.",
      "NOTE: UCF files can be created with the WebEx Universal Communications Toolkit, which includes a program called the WebEx Document Manager. This program functions as a standalone application or as a browser plug-in. Users must have Microsoft PowerPoint installed to enable the software."
