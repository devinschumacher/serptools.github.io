      "The Ketron DJL Compiler allows audio enthusiasts to create DJ loops to play with the Ketron Midijay Live Audio Player. Each loop consists of eight WAV files: an Intro, Arrs A - D, a Fill, a Break, and an Ending.",
      "If a user wants to save an in-process DJL Compiler project as a DJP file, they can do so by selecting File â†’ Save Dfl Project from the program's menu bar. Each DJP file contains a list of the audio files in that project, including the files' locations. It also stores the project's copyright and tempo/BPM information."
