      "Z-code files use a programming language called the Zork Implementation Language. The file extensions use a numerical value for the version of the Z-machine that is used to run them. Since version 8 was the last Z-machine version, Z8 is the most popular of the extensions, although you may also see Z-code files with the .Z1 , .Z2 , .Z3 , .Z4 , .Z5 , .Z6 , and .Z7 extensions."
