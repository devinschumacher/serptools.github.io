      "watchX is a smartwatch for which users can create their own programs. For example, watchX users could create and install a program that allows their watch to sense and measure its own movement.",
      "Typically, users create watchX programs using watchX Blocks, a block-based code editor. WatchX Blocks saves watchX programs as WXB files.",
      "To upload the program a WXB file contains to a watchX, users must:",
      "The program will then appear on the user's watchX.",
      "NOTE: In addition to watchX Blocks' default block-based display, the program also shows the code WXB files contain as Arduino Source Code, akin to the code found in .INO files, and as XML."
