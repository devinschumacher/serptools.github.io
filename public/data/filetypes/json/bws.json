      "Brady Workstation and Brady Express Labels are label design programs that allow users to create and print labels for products, laboratory materials, hazardous materials, and other items. These labels may consist of icons, barcodes, text, and other graphic design elements.",
      "Each label a user creates in Brady Workstation and Brady Express Labels is saved as a BWS file. After a user finishes creating a label, they can send that label's BWS file to a compatible Brady label printer, to print that label. Brady Workstation is compatible with all Brady label printers except the M211. Brady Label Express is compatible with the Brady M211, BMP51, M610, M611, M710 and BMP61 printers."
