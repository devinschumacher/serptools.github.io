      "SBP files are used for storing files in a location that can be accessed by both the desktop and iOS versions of Sketchbook. When saving an SBP file, Sketchbook Express changes the dimensions of the image so that it will fit on the iOS device's screen. Also, the number of maximum layers is reduced to six.",
