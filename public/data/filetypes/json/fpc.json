      "FreePCB and its successor, FreePCB-2, are free Windows programs that PCB designers can use to create and edit digital PCBs. After they finish editing a PCB, designers can export that PCB in file formats used by PCB manufacturers, so the manufacturer can create a real-life copy of the PCB.",
      "FreePCB saves users' PCB design projects as FPC files. Each FPC file is a plain text file that includes many sections, each of which specifies some subset of data about the PCB the file describes."
