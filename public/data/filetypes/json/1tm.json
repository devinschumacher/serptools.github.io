      "1tracker is a chiptune music tracker developed by Shiru (aka shiru8bit) of the website Shiru's Stuff. It allows users to create and export musical tracks that sound like 1-bit video game music.",
      "Songs created in 1tracker are saved as 1TM files. The song a 1TM file contains can consist of up to nine channels, used to play notes with different instruments. Labels and breaks may appear at the beginning and end of various parts of the song, to denote different sections (such as an intro, verse, or chorus)."
