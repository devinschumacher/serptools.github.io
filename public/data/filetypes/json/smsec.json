      "StarMade's allows you to explore the universe finding materials to upgrade your ship and fend off attacks from enemies. In the game you navigate through sectors, which may contain space stations, other ships, asteroids, planets, stars, or nothing at all.",
      "These sectors are the smallest units of space in the StarMade universe. They are configurable but approximately 5,000 meters on each side. Sectors are contained in 16x16x16 areas known as systems in the game.",
      "There are several types of sectors in StarMade, with each one providing different challenges:",
      "StarMade allows you to export and import sectors for sharing purposes. When you export a sector, an SMSEC file is created to store all the information of the sector. The file is meant to be opened only within StarMade but it is compressed in the Zip format, which allows you to manually extract its contents with a utility such as 7-Zip or WinZip."
