      "Camtasia can create various types of videos, such as video game recordings, tutorials, training videos, and webinar recordings. While Camtasia is available for macOS and Windows, only the macOS version of Camtasia saves projects as CMPROJ files.",
      "The Windows version saves projects as .TSCPROJ files (replaced the .CAMPROJ file type with version 9 of TechSmith Camtasia). If you are using the macOS version of Camtasia, you can also create TSCPROJ files by selecting File → Export → Project for Windows .",
      "To create a CMPROJ file with the macOS version of Camtasia, follow these steps: Select File → New Project or New Project From Template... (if you have not yet started a project) Select File → Save or Save As... Name the project, choose the save location, then click Save"
