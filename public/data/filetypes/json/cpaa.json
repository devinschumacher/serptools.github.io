      "The CPAA file is used to transfer and apply advanced actions from one Captivate project to another. The file functions similar to a script template as it allows you to reuse a set of actions. This ability helps you save time as you can insert previously used actions instead of starting from scratch.",
      "To export a CPAA file, select Project → Advanced Actions , choose your action from the \"Create from\" drop down menu, and click the \"Export\" folder icon. You can also click the shared action from the Adobe Captivate Library and select the \"Export\" folder icon.",
      "To import a CPAA file, select Project → Advanced Actions , choose the \"Import\" folder icon. You can also select the \"Import\" folder icon from the Adobe Captivate Library."
