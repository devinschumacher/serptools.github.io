      "Jewel Quest is a series of tile-matching games available for Windows, macOS, and mobile devices. On Windows, Jewel Quest II saves users' game progress in JQ2SAVEGAME files, which are located in the C:/​Users/​YourUserName/​Saved Games/​iWin/​Jewel Quest 2/​YourUserName directory.",
      "However, those looking to use their JQ2SAVEGAME file to transfer a saved Jewel Quest II game from one computer to another will be disappointed. Because Jewel Quest II forces players to create a new account each time they launch the game on a new PC, and JQ2SAVEGAME files are tied to specific Jewel Quest II accounts, transferring a JQ2SAVEGAME file to a new PC will not cause your previously saved game to appear in Jewel Quest II."
