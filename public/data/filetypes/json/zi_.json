      "ZI_ files are created when a user compresses one or more files as in the Zip format but then renames the \".zip\" extension as \".zi_\". If you receive a ZI_ file, simply rename the extension as \".zip\" and open it with a Zip compression program, such as Corel WinZip, RARLAB WinRAR, Apple Archive Utility, or B1 Free Archiver."
