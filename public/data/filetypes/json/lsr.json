      "IT professionals primarily use LANsurveyor to manage networks, which includes monitoring security threats and the performance of connected nodes. One of the LANsurveyor's capabilities is its ability to generate reports customized by users. Users can save generated reports as LSR files, which they can close, then re-open without losing information.",
      "NOTE: Neon Software originally developed LANsurveyor, but SolarWinds acquired Neon Software in 2007. SolarWinds then discontinued LANsurveyor and replaced it with Network Topology Mapper."
