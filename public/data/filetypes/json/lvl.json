      "LVL files are used by a number of different games including LucasArts Star Wars Battlefront, Parallax Descent 2, Rockstar Games Max Payne, WOM Games Snood, and Lasertank.",
      "Game level files typically should not be opened manually, since they are automatically loaded by the corresponding program. However some LVL files can be edited using a level editor such as the LVL Extractor for Star Wars BattleFront levels."
