      "Atlus developed several PlayStation 2 entries in the Megami Tensei RPG franchise. Some of these games include Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne, Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army, and Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga.",
      "All these games include videos saved as IPU files. These videos do not contain audio. Some IPU files are stored within .IPS files, which combine the video an IPU file contains with audio encoded using the ADPCM codec , producing a video with sound.",
      "While Atlus RPGs are the most popular games to include IPU files, the IPU format is not unique to Atlus games. Therefore, you may encounter IPU videos in games created by other developers."
