      "Paperless can sort the receipt images by date and other metadata . The program also uses Mariner's optical character recognition ( OCR ) technology to identify receipt text such as the price, payment method, and merchant. Users can then sort and search receipts using this information in the software. Paperless also stores digital document libraries in .DWLIBRARY files.",
