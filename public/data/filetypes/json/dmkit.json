      "FL Studio is a digital audio workstation ( DAW ) that music creators and editors use to compose, edit, and mix music. FL Studio users can install a number of plug-ins that add features, such as additional audio effects and synthesized instruments, to the program. Drumaxx is one such plug-in.",
      "Installing Drumaxx allows users to synthesize a variety of drums and other percussion instruments. Because so many real-life drums exist, Drumaxx allows users to load a variety of synthesized drum kits. These synthesized drum kits are saved as DMKIT files.",
      "Each DMKIT file contains a set of sixteen drum pads, as well as musical sequences associated with those pads. After loading a DMKIT file in Drumaxx, users can use Drumaxx to synthesize drum and other percussion sounds or, if they want to adjust the drum pads their DMKIT file contains, edit the drum kit itself."
