      "HotDocs form documents can be populated using HotDocs Filler, a program included with the HotDocs suite. If you double-click an HFD file, HotDocs Filler opens by default. You can also fill an HFD form using a prepared answer .ANX file.",
      "NOTE: The HFD format was designed using the Envoy document format (promoted by the WordPerfect Corporation), which was an early competitor to Adobe's .PDF format. HotDocs also adopted the PDF format and can create digital forms in the .HPD (HotDocs PDF Document) format."
