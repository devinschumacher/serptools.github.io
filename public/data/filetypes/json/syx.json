      "Unlike other types of MIDI message files, SysEx messages' format vary from manufacturer to manufacturer and device to device. This means a SYX file that works with one type of MIDI device may not work with another.",
      "However, this format variability also allows users to use SYX files for many different purposes. For example, users can use SYX files to back up data from atypical devices, such as MIDI-compliant lighting controllers, or transmit firmware updates."
