      "AMV files are a variant of .AVI files that are used by some Chinese media players. Notably, AMV files include the text AMV and amvh in their headers, where AVI files would contain the text AMI and avih . The files' audio is compressed is using the PCM audio codec.",
      "The AMV format was designed to allow cheaply-made media players that use the Actions semiconductor chip to store and play many low-quality videos. AMV videos are not highly compressed, but their initial file size is so low (due to their low resolution and frame rate ) that even inexpensive media players can store and play back a number of AMV videos."
