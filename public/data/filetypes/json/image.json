      "Squeak is a programming language and development environment that was created by developers at Apple and Disney. The Squeak language is based on the Smalltalk-80 language. Squeak is now open-source, meaning anyone can download the Squeak development environment and create programs using the Squeak programming language.",
      "The Squeak development environment comes packaged as an .EXE file, .DMG file, or other executable, which is used to launch a Squeak VM. In their VM, developers can develop programs using the Squeak programming language. When a developer saves a Squeak development session, the session is saved as an IMAGE file. A developer can load their IMAGE file the next time they start a Squeak VM, to resume their development session."
