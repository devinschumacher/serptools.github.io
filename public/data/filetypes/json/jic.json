      "The JIC format is primarily associated with Intel's Quartus Prime development software, which engineers use to design logic for FPGAs and other programmable logic devices. When generating a JIC file, engineers typically include the FPGA's programming data along with any necessary bootloaders or supporting logic that must be stored in non-volatile memory.",
      "A JIC file typically stores the following:",
      "NOTE: The JTAG interface is a common method for programming and debugging digital systems, and the JIC format is one of several supported by Intel tools to deliver configuration data to target devices through the interface."
