      "The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) developed the DICOM format. They designed the format to exchange and view medical images, such as CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasound images.",
      "NEMA released the initial DICOM standard in 1983 and has released various revisions throughout the 1990s and 2000s. The association still actively maintains the format.",
      "NOTE: DICOM images more commonly use the .DCM extension."
