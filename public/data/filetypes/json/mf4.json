      "MDF is developed by Vector and was originally released in 1991 as MDF 2.0. It soon became the standard format used in the automotive industry to store measurement data in regards to development, testing, and calibration of vehicles. MDF 3.0 was released in 2002, which uses the .MDF file extension. In 2008, an ASAM group revised the MDF standard and released ASAM MDF 4.0 in 2009, then ASAM MDF 4.1 in 2012."
