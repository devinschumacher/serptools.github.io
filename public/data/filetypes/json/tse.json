      "Toyota Techstream is a Windows application that service technicians can use to connect to, retrieve information from, and program Toyota, Scion, and Lexus vehicles. It is typically installed on laptops or tablets. While performing a diagnostic service session, technicians can save a log of the actions they performed in Techstream to a TSE file. They can also export a log of the actions as a .CSV file, for use in other programs."
