      "Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze is a platforming video game available for the Wii U and Nintendo Switch. It was developed by Retro Studios, an American subsidiary of Nintendo.",
      "Tropical Freeze is the first Retro Studios game to use SMDL files. Unlike many other types of 3D model files, SMDL files contain a model's mesh, textures, and animations in the same file. Thus, Tropical Freeze can load a single SMDL file to show and animate an in-game character."
