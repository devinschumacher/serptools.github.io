      "MSN Webcam Recorder was an open-source tool that MSN Messenger, Windows Live Messenger, and aMSN users could use to record the videos they and their contacts streamed within Messenger. The program automatically detected when a user or a contact they were chatting with began streaming using Messenger's Webcam feature. Then, it saved the users' streamed video as ML20 files.",
      "NOTE: ML20 files are named after the ML20 video codec that MSN Messenger and its siblings used to encode and decode video files."
