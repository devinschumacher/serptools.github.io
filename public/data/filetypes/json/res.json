      "RES files became prevalent in 1998 with the release of Half-Life, which was the first title from Valve Software. The files were used to store locations of resources instead of the resources themselves to reduce download times. When playing a game, such as Half-Life, the RES file is referenced by the game if the player is playing a custom map then downloads the resources, making them playable within the game.",
      "But as download speeds have increased, new resource formats have been released, and the game engine evolved, actual RES files have become less common. Now, RES files are typically embedded into the map files they are associated with, using BSPZIP, a command-line tool. However, if a map with embedded resource lists cannot be accepted, the RES file can be used.",
      "If the BSP map is incorrectly loaded by the game, it is most likely due to a typo in one or more of the resource paths. You can use a text editor to view and edit the RES file.",
      "NOTE: In order for a RES file to be recognized by a game, it must be placed in the \\â€‹maps folder with the BSP map it is associated with and must also bear the same name as the BSP map."
