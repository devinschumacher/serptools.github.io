      "IF can be described as a literary video game. Users play through a narrative created by the author but can control characters with text commands and interact with the environment in the story. Inform is a free application that allows users to create and share custom IF stories that other users can experience.",
      "When a user is finished creating his IF in Inform 7, he clicks \"Go!\" in the user interface. Inform 7 then compiles the Inform 7 (I7) source code that makes up the story into I6 code. During this process, Inform utilizes the code stored in I6T files to generate output according to what the original source code requires. I6T files are included with distributions of Inform 7."
