      "ANN files are only used to describe Lingvo-formatted dictionaries. This format is developed by ABBYY, an international software company. ANN files are optional, but if they are created, they are named after an associated .DSL file (e.g., example.dsl and example.ann ). ANN files should be placed in the same folder as the DSL file.",
      "NOTE: You can view the information in an ANN file by double-clicking the icon of the dictionary located on the Bookshelf in Lingvo Dictionary."
