      "Businesses use FileMaker Pro to input, track, and manage critical business data. Since its initial release in 1990, the program has had many versions. FileMaker Inc. released FileMaker Pro 5 in 1999 and FileMaker Pro 6 in 2002.",
      "Versions 5 and 6 of FileMaker Pro save users' databases as FP5 files. These files contain one or more data tables, which users often view in spreadsheet form. For example, a user might open an FP5 file that contains a record of their business's inventory, to note how many of a particular item they have on hand or from which vendor they purchase the item.",
      "NOTE: FileMaker Inc. was previously known as Claris. The company changed its name back to Claris in 2020."
