      "NED files do not specify the behavior of the network. Instead, they behavior is defined by a complementary C++ source code file ( .CC or .CPP file). Once a NED file and the corresponding C++ behavior file are created, the network can be simulated.",
      "Network description files can be created using a plain text editor, or by using the OMNeT++ IDE, which is included with the OMNeT++ download package.",
      "NOTE: OMNeT is also referred to as \"omnipp,\" where \"pp\" stands for \"plus plus.\""
