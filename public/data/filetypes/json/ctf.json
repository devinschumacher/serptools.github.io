      "WhereIsIt was an application developed by Robert Galle. It allowed users to catalog and organize their physical and digital media, to make it easy to see what media they owned and where that media was stored.",
      "For digital media, users could record the files' location. For example, if an MP3 file was stored on a removable drive, a user could note that information in their catalog."
