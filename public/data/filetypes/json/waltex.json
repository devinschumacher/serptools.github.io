      "Walaber Entertainment is the name of developer Tim FitzRandolph's independent game development studio. While working with Creature Feep, a division of Disney Mobile, FitzRandolph was the game design director for the Where's My Water? series of games.",
      "Several later entries in the Where's My Water series, including Where's My Perry?, Where's My Mickey?, Where's My Water? Featuring XYY, and Where's My Water? 2 include textures saved in the WALTEX format. FitzRandolph created this format, thus it is named after his online alias, Walaber."
