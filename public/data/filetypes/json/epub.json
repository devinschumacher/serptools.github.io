      "The International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF) initially released the EPUB format in 2007 as a replacement for the Open eBook (OEB) format. EPUB has undergone several revisions since its release, with its most recent version, 3.3, released in May 2023.",
      "The EPUB format is Zip-based and stores resources that make up the publication, including .XML , .XHTML , .NCX , .CSS , and .SVG files. These files contain the publication's contents, including its text, chapter links, cover art, and images. Many commercial eBooks also include digital rights management ( DRM ) protection, which limits viewing to only authorized devices."
