      "Brick Hill is a free game that features gameplay similar to ROBLOX. Users can create their own custom avatars, build worlds with digital bricks, and interact with other gamers in those worlds.",
      "Workshop is a free utility available for download on the Brick Hill website. The application enables Brick Hill users to develop their own worlds, or games, that can be uploaded to and hosted on the \"node-hill\" servers for other gamers to play. When a user creates and saves Brick Hill content in Workshop, the application creates a BRK file to store the information.",
      "To create a BRK file with Workshop, select the \"New file\" icon, create your content, then click the \"Save\" floppy disk icon, and choose the save location for the BRK file."
