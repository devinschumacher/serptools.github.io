      "MAPX files reside on a Mapjects Web server and are parsed by the Web server to deliver the rich client content through a Web browser. They reference backend Mapjects .MAP data files, which contain the data and program code for the Webparts that are displayed. The Mapjects Web server supports rendering of HTML5, Silverlight, Flash, and PHP, as well as code for the ASP.NET Razor engine.",
