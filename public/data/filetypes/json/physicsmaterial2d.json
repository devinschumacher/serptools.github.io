      "You will most likely only encounter PHYSICSMATERIAL2D files if you are a game developer building a game with Unity. The information in the file dictates the friction and bounciness of a material. For example, if you wanted to create a bouncy object, you would set the \"bounciness\" value to be a high number (0 is no bounce, while 1 is a perfect bounce with no lost momentum).",
      "You can open and modify a PHYSICSMATERIAL2D file with Unity Editor, which is included with Unity. To create a PHYSICSMATERIAL2D file with Unity, right-click the files area in the window, and select Create â†’ Physics Material 2D ."
