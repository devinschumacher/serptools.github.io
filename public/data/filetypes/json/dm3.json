      "Id Software released Quake III Arena in late 1999. This entry in the popular Quake series focused on online, multiplayer gameplay.",
      "To allow players to review and study previous matches, Quake III included a recording function that players could use to record their gameplay. To begin recording, players entered the /record console command. To stop recording, they entered /stoprecord . In versions 1.11 to 1.17, Quake III saved the recordings players created as DM3 files.",
      "Players could review and play the DM3 files they'd created using Quake III's Demos menu. They could also use the /demo console command to play a specific DM3 file.",
      "NOTE: Later versions of Quake III save demos as .dm_48 , .dm_66 , .dm_67 , and .DM_68 files."
