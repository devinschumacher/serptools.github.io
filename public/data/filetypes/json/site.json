      "Adobe GoLive was a website creation and management program that web developers could use to create, edit, and maintain websites. Developers' GoLive projects were saved in SITE files, which were stored in the root level of a website project's folder.",
      "GoLive also automatically created backup SITE files, named ProjectName Backup.site , in case a developer's original SITE file went missing or was corrupted. These backup SITE files were also stored in the root level of a project's folder.",
      "NOTE: In 2008, Adobe discontinued GoLive. GoLive was replaced by Adobe Dreamweaver."
