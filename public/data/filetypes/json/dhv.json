      "The DHV format is one of several embroidery formats developed by Husqvarna, along with .HUS .SHV , .VIP , .VP3 and .VP4 . DHV is supported by several embroidery machine models, which include Husqvarna Viking Designer SE, Husqvarna Viking Designer Topaz 50, and Husqvarna Viking Designer Epic. Since the DHV format is older, it comes with several limitations including a 5\" high x 7\" wide embroidery area.",
      "To transfer a DHV file to a sewing machine, insert a USB storage device in your computer. Then, copy the DHV file from your computer and move it to the connected storage device via File Explorer in Windows or Finder in macOS. After transferring the file, eject the storage device from your computer and insert it into the Husqvarna Viking sewing machine to transfer the design to embroider it onto the material.",
