      "Signs and banners stored in PD files can be opened by FlexiSIGN. The design can then be printed on a wide format printer and cut by a vinyl cutter. FlexiSIGN can also connect to a print and cut all-in-one machine.",
      "If you want to share PD files with another person that does not own FlexiSIGN, you can convert your PD files. FlexiSIGN allows you to export your designs to the more widely supported JPEG and PDF formats.",
