      "Tamino Schema Editor is a GUI-based application that Tamino XML Server users can use to create and edit Tamino Schemas. The schemas users create in the Tamino Schema Editor are saved as TSD files.",
      "Each TSD file is an XML file that may contain additional, Tamino-specific elements. These Tamino-specific elements begin with the tag tsd: . For example, each TSD file typically includes a tsd:schemaInfo name = \"name\" element, which specifies the schema's name.",
      "After a user finishes editing their TSD file, they can import it into Tamino X-Plorer to define a Tamino XML Server database."
