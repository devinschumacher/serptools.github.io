      "Streaming allows users to play video and/or audio over the Internet while it progressively downloads. Kodi, Plex, Emby, and other streaming media players allow users to stream their own video or audio files, saved on a personal computer or server, or files stored on the Internet.",
      "An STRM file contains a URL that points to content a user wants to stream. To play the content, users open the STRM file. The media player then uses the URL the file contains to locate the content and begin streaming it.",
      "While most STRM files contain a simple URL, some contain URLs written in formats used only by a specific media player or plug-in. For example, an STRM file used to play a YouTube video in Kodi will contain a URL written specifically to work with Kodi's YouTube player plug-in.",
      "To create an STRM file:",
      "NOTE: If opening an STRM file in your streaming media player does not cause content to start playing, the URL your STRM file contains may be incorrect, or your player may not support the stream codec ."
