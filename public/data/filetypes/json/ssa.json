      "Sub Station Alpha is a program that allows you to create custom subtitles for videos. For example, many English-speaking anime fans use Sub Station Alpha to create subtitles for non-dubbed anime.",
      "Subtitles created using Sub Station Alpha are saved in the SSA format. Each SSA file is a plain text file that includes three sections:",
      "Some other subtitle-creation programs, such as Aegisub and Gnome Subtitles, also allow you to save subtitles in the SSA format. However, at this point, the .ASS (Aegisub Advanced SubStation Alpha) format has largely replaced the SSA format.",
      "You can validate that the subtitles your SSA file contains are formatted correctly by uploading the file to the Subtitle Validator available at https://validator.subtitledpro.com/."
