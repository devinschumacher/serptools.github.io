      "In the Descent series of games, players pilot a spaceship on a series of missions to destroy mines infected by an alien computer virus. Interplay Productions and Parallax Software released the first Descent in 1995 for MS-DOS and Mac; they released Descent 2 in 1996.",
      "Both Descent and Descent 2 store their mission data in a single HOG file. In Descent, this file is named descent.hog . In Descent 2, this file is named descent2.hog . Descent and Descent 2 modders often extract the constituent files HOG files contain, to modify the games' gameplay. After modifying the games' files, modders repackage them in their associated HOG file.",
      "NOTE: Modders using custom Descent level creators can create custom HOG files, which may have names other than descent.hog or descent2.hog ."
