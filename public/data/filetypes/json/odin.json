      "The Locky virus is hazardous malware that people commonly refer to as ransomware. The purpose of the virus is to take your files hostage and force you to pay the perpetrator (by way of Bitcoin) to unlock your files.",
      "The virus is a trojan horse typically introduced through a file attached to a spam email. Once the virus affects your computer, it scrambles, renames, and encrypts your files. The virus then generates \"_HOWDO_text.bmp,\" \"_HOWDO_text.html,\" and \"_[2_digit_number]_HOWDO_text.html\" files that contain instructions informing you of the takeover and what you need to do to recover your files."
