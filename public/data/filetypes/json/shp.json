      "Autodesk 3D Studio was the precursor to 3ds Max. Just like 3ds Max, 3D Studio allowed users to create 3D models and animations.",
      "In 3D Studio, users could use the 2D Shaper to draw one or more 2D polygons. They could then save these drawings as SHP files (allowing them to reuse their drawing across multiple models)."
