      "In 2014, French hackers Jankenpopp and Zombectro created Windows 93. The web-based \"operating system,\" which can be found at Windows93.net, allows users to access a number of clever, comedic programs, including:",
      "When a user right-clicks a Windows 93 desktop shortcut and selects Download As... , the user's web browser downloads an LNK42 file. LNK42 files contain information Windows 93 uses to open an associated program. For example, the file Recorder.lnk42 contains information ( \"exe\":\"recorder\" ) Windows 93 uses to open its Recorder program.",
      "In some cases, LNK42 files also include the path at which a shortcut's icon can be found. Continuing the prior example, Recorder.lnk42 tells users its icon is located at /​c/​sys/​skins/​w93/​apps/​recorder.png in Windows 93."
