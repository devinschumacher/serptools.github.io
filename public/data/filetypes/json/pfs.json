      "When the code within a PFS file is run by PhotoFiltre Studio, coordinates are connected by lines. Upon reaching the last coordinate, a line joins back to the starting point. Strictly speaking, the selection file is just a regular plain text file, however it is saved in the PFS file instead of a .TXT file."
