      "Unix-like OSes include a system manual that is divided into eight numbered sections. This manual's fifth section usually describes the file formats the system supports. Each supported format is documented in a separate 5 file.",
      "For example, the file deb.5 describes the .DEB file format. It also provides a list of additional related entries.",
      "In some Unix systems, such as System V, 5 files instead contain documentation of miscellaneous system information. These 5 files can still be accessed using the man utility.",
      "NOTE: Other sections' Unix man pages use the .1 , .2 , .3 , .4 , .6 , .7 , and .8 extensions. Man pages are also commonly compressed into .GZ files (which may use the .gz.# extension)."
