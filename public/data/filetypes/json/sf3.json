      "Scientists use Proteome Software Scaffold to record results of protein and peptide identification experiments conducted using mass spectrometry. These results, which contain information about identified proteins and peptides' names, the spectra used to identify the proteins and peptides, and the probability that the identifications are correct, are saved as SF3 files.",
      "Scaffold users can view SF3 files in many different views, including the Load Data View, Samples View, Proteins View, Similarity View, Quantify View, Publish View, and Statistics View. Each view allows scientists to view and analyze the results an SF3 file contains in a different way. For example, the Samples View is a protein-centric view that gives information about proteins identified, GO terms, and quantitative values.",
      "After they've finished their analysis, scientists may share their SF3 file with others. Users who do not have access to a paid copy of Scaffold can still use Scaffold to open and view SF3 files, by installing and activating Scaffold in Viewer Mode."
