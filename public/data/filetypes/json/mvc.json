      "Movie Collector was a desktop program that allowed you to manage your physical and digital movie libraries, offering tools to organize, search, and filter movie details. When you save a catalog with Movie Collector, the program creates an MVC file to store its contents, which you can back up or share with other Movie Collector users.",
      "NOTE: Collectorz.com no longer develops Movie Collector since it transitioned to a cloud-based system that syncs catalog data through CLZ Cloud across devices, including its CLZ Movies mobile app. This transition has made MVC files obsolete."
