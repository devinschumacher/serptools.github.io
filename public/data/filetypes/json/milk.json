      "Music visualization plug-ins and applications transform audio input into often-psychedelic animations that can be used as desktop wallpapers, screensavers, or videos. To transform audio input into video output, music visualization programs utilize preset files, which contain a variety of audio- and visual-related settings. For example, a preset file may specify what color waveforms appear in an animation.",
      "MILK files are MilkDrop preset files. Using a variety of text-based settings, they determine how MilkDrop transforms audio input into animations. Different MILK files use different values for each setting, allowing MilkDrop to produce distinct visuals for the same piece of audio content.",
      "NOTE: projectM's .PRJM files are very similar to MILK files."
