      "Kodu Game Lab is a game development program used to teach children about programming. For example, a teacher might use Kodu as part of a middle school game development curriculum.",
      "To create levels in Kodu, developers create a world, place game objects, and program those game objects using a tile-based programming language. Developers can export their finished Kodu games, comprised of one more levels, as .KODU files. Developers can also export a single level as a .KODU2 file.",
      "Exporting a single level as a KODU2 file can be useful if, for example, a developer needs to turn in only a single level for a homework assignment. It can also be useful if the developer has a question about the code contained in the level, and wants to share only that level with another user."
