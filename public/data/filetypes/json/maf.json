      "To allow database managers to more easily enter data into or retrieve data from a Microsoft Access database, the program allows managers to create and link forms with database tables. To create a form, managers select the table for which they want to create a form, select Create from Microsoft Access's menu bar, and then select Form . Access then creates a form that contains fields linked to the table's columns.",
      "Each Microsoft Access form is saved as an MAF file. You can open an MAF file in Microsoft Access to edit the form's fields and appearance, using Access's Form Layout Tools. You can also use a form to search for or enter data into a database, provided you have access to that database.",
      "Forms may include subforms, which show information from related tables. For example, a form used to search for or add customers to a database may include a subform that shows information about customers' orders, which is stored in a related table.",
      "After you finish creating a Microsoft Access form, you may want to set that form as your database's default form. This will cause the form to appear automatically each time you open the database. To set a form as a database's default form:"
