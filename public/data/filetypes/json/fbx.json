      "While the FBX format is proprietary, many non-Autodesk modeling and animation applications can open FBX files. This allows creators to share 3D models in the FBX format, which is efficient because it stores models as binary data.",
      "Model creators can convert models to the FBX format using Blender (multiplatform) or Autodesk FBX Converter (Windows and Mac, but unsupported as of 2013). For example, Autodesk FBX Converter can convert .OBJ , .DXF , .3DS , and .DAE (COLLADA) files to the FBX format.",
      "NOTE: Kaydara originally developed the FBX format for use in Kaydara MotionBuilder. Autodesk acquired Kaydara in 2006."
