      "IML files store module-level settings for larger development projects. IntelliJ IDEA uses .IPR or .IDEA files (depending on the project's version) to store overall project settings. These files may reference multiple IML files. IPR and IML files both use XML formatting.",
      "If you accidentally delete a module's IML file, you can often regenerate the file by either opening and closing your IDE, rebuilding your project, or reimporting your project.",
      "NOTE: Android Studio, an Android software development tool based on the IntelliJ IDEA engine, also uses IML files to store information for Android development modules."
