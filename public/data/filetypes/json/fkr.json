      "Businesses use IwantSoft FKL to monitor their employees' PC usage. Periodically, FKL sends reports of users' activities to an administrator via email, FTP , a local network, or Dropbox. These reports are saved as FKR files.",
      "Administrators can open FKR files in FKL's Report Viewer to view the information they contain. The report's Log section shows all the activities a user performed, divided into categories. By default, this information is listed chronologically. The report's Analytics section shows bar graphs of a user's application and website usage."
