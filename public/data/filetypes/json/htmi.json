      "Developers can use the HTMI format to encode and embed binary files within an HTML document that is meant to be viewed in a web browser. Then, when a user opens the HTMI file in their web browser, the browser will automatically read the binary file without the aid of any additional programs.",
      "HTMI is an interoperable format that can be embedded in any other text MIME type format. HTMI content is most often embedded or referenced externally within HTML and server languages, and it is usually used to add DRM to media files.",
      "NOTE: HTMI files can be opened offline or online in 64-bit and 32-bit systems."
