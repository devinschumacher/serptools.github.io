      "Casual and professional designers primarily use Microsoft Publisher to design marketing materials and other documents. The software is only available for Windows as part of the Microsoft 365 subscription service or as a one-time, standalone purchase.",
      "When you save a document in Publisher, the program creates a PUB file to store the document's contents. After saving the PUB file, you can close and re-open the PUB file to continue editing the document at a later time.",
      "NOTE: Besides saving page layouts as PUB files, advanced Publisher users may also create PUB files to integrate and store data sources for mail merges and generating data sheets."
