      "Most email applications, such as Microsoft Outlook, Apple Mail, and Mozilla Thunderbird, support digital signatures. However, if an email program does not handle digital signatures, a P7S file may appear as an attachment ( smime.p7s ) to a digitally signed email message.",
      "NOTE: Email programs that use P7S files use PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography Standard) #7 to sign email messages."
