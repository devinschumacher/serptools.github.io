      "Blockbench is a cross-platform 3D model editor. It is used primarily to create and edit block-based Minecraft models.",
      "Blockbench allows users to customize the program's keymapping, using settings found in the Keybindings window (opened by selecting File → Preferences... → Keybindings... ). For example, a user can change the shortcuts used to access Blockbench tools, perform view actions, import textures, transform a model, and so on.",
      "If a user wants to transfer their custom keymappings between instances of Blockbench, they can do so by exporting their keymappings as a BBKEYMAP file. Each BBKEYMAP file is a plain text file, which saves users' keymappings as JSON data.",
