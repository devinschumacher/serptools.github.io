      "The Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) is an international workgroup that sets standards for media compression and encoding. Most notably, MPEG sets standards for video and audio compression. In 1995, MPEG created the MPEG-2 video and audio compression standard, which improved upon the original MPEG-1 compression standard.",
      "MPEG2 files contain video that has been compressed using MPEG-2. They are not as common as .MPG or .MPG2 files, which also contain MPEG-2 video. Audio files compressed using the MPEG-2 codec are saved with the .MP2 extension."
