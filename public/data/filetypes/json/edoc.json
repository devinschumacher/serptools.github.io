      "You can attach a variety of files to an EDOC file, such as documents, spreadsheets, images, and videos. However, users typically attach office documents, like .PDF , .DOC , .DOCX , .XLS , and .XLSX files, to an EDOC file.",
      "To add a signature to an EDOC file, you must have an eParaksts electronic signature smartcard from the Latvia State Radio and Television Center (LVRTC) or an eID identity card from the Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs (OCMA). There are varying levels of signatures you can add to an EDOC file:",
      "Once you add a signature to the EDOC file, you can no longer attach files to or remove files from the EDOC file. However, you can still view or export the attached files.",
      "NOTE: EUSO SignAnywhere Free supports EDOC files but has been discontinued."
