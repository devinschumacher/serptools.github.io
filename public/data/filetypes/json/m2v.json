      "While most video files created using MPEG-2 compression (such as .MPG and .MPEG files) contain both video and audio data, M2V files contain only video. M2V files are most often used to create DVD movies, because many DVD-authoring tools require users to import separate video and audio files.",
      "Some video-editing programs, such as Adobe Premiere and After Effects, allow users to export their videos in the M2V format. Users can then use DVD-authoring applications, such as DVD Flick and CyberLink Power Director, to combine their M2V file with an audio file and produce a finalized movie."
