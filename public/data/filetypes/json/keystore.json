      "A KEYSTORE file is used for several security purposes. It can be used to identify the author of an Android app during a build and when publishing to Google Play or in SSL encryption.",
      "Since a KEYSTORE file contains valuable data, the file is encrypted and protected by a password to secure the file from unauthorized parties. There is no way to retrieve your KEYSTORE file if you lose it, so be sure to back it up.",
      "NOTE: The KEYSTORE extension is similar to the .JKS extension."
