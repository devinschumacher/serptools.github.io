      "Typically, SAV files are either saved in a raw format if transferred from a Nintendo DS device or are saved in the NO$GBA format if saved by the NO$GBA emulator (or exported by the DeSmuME emulator). Additionally, you will likely find SAV files with .NDS Nintendo DS ROM files, which are sometimes required for the ROM to run properly.",
      "When transferring SAV files to a new Nintendo DS flash card, you must ensure the file format is compatible, or the saved game may not load. Additionally, you may need to modify the binary data in the SAV file with a hexadecimal (hex) editor (e.g., HxD) to load it."
