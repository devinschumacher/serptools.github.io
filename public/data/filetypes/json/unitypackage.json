      "Unity is a popular video game development application available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Developers can use Unity to create 2D and 3D games for a variety of platforms, including video game consoles, PCs, and mobile devices.",
      "As a developer creates a game in Unity, they add various assets, including character models, materials, shaders, audio files, scenes, and other resources, to that game. If the developer wants to reuse any of these assets in another Unity development project, they can do so by packaging the assets in a UNITYPACKAGE file. The developer can then easily import the UNITYPACKAGE file, and all the assets it contains, into future projects, so they do not have to start developing from scratch.",
      "To export a set of Unity assets as a UNITYPACKAGE file:",
      "Unity will then save your assets in a UNITYPACKAGE file."
