      "In watchOS 7 and later, users can share customized Apple Watch faces, which are saved as WATCHFACE files. When a user adds a WATCHFACE file as a watch face, their Apple Watch checks for the apps that provide that watch face's complications. If the user is missing any requisite apps, their Apple Watch prompts them to install the missing apps.",
      "To share a watch face from your Apple Watch, press firmly on the watch face. Then, press the share button that appears, and use Messages to send your watch face to another iOS or Apple Watch user.",
      "On iOS devices, you can share an Apple Watch face by opening the face in the Apple Watch app and selecting the share button that appears in the app's upper right-hand corner."
