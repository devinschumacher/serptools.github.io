      "STB files were developed to abstract plot styles from color-based layer styles to object-based property styles, which allows greater flexibility and portability of designs. Color-based styles are defined by .CTB files, and cannot be mixed with STB files in AutoCAD projects.",
      "CTB files may be converted to STB files using AutoCAD."
