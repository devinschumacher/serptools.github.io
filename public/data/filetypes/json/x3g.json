      "The X3G format is designed to deliver instructions from a 3D model file, such as a .STL or .OBJ file, to a 3D printer in order to print the model. X3G files are primarily used by MakerBot Replicator and can be sent to the printer via an SD card or connected USB cable.",
      "NOTE: X3G files replaced .S3G files with the release of MakerBot Replicator 2, and were themselves replaced by .MAKERBOT files."
