      "Brother CanvasWorkspace is a free program that allows sewing and embroidery enthusiasts to design patterns for use with Brother cutting machines, such as the DC200, CM650W, SDX225, and many others. CanvasWorkspace saves these patterns as .CWPRJ and FCM files. CWPRJ files are editable project files that a user can use to edit an existing pattern. FCM files are typically finished patterns, which are meant to be transferred to a cutting machine.",
      "While CWPRJ files can contain multiple colors and other complex design elements, FCM files contain only simple, black-and-white shapes. That's because the files are intended for use with a cutting machine, which uses only each shape's outline. However, you can open an FCM file in Brother CanvasWorkspace, to view the shapes it contains and transfer it to a cutting machine.",
      "You can convert existing .SVG files into FCM files, for use with a Brother cutting machine. To do so:",
      "Your SVG file will then open in CanvasWorkspace. Edit your file as needed, and then select File â†’ Export/Transfer FCM file... to export the file as an FCM file."
