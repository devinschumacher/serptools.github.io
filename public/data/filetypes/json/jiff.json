      "JIFF and .JIF files were more common in the 1990s before improved variations of the JPEG format superseded the JIFF format. Image editors for Windows and Mac then began saving images as JPG and JPEG files, which led to the obsolescence of JIFF files.",
      "Images saved in the JPEG format still typically use the .jpeg or .jpg file extension. However, they may also use the .jpe ( .JPE files), .jfif ( .JFIF files), and .jfi ( .JFI files) file extensions."
