      "Toyota Entune is a media, navigation, and telematics system installed in some Toyota automobiles. It allows drivers to play music, check weather and traffic conditions, and in some models, navigate via GPS. Entune premiered in 2011, as part of the 2012 Toyota Prius v, and is available in most subsequent Toyota models.",
      "Periodically, Toyota issues updates for Toyota Entune, which are meant to enhance users' experience with the system and fix bugs. These updates can be downloaded from Toyota's website and installed in Toyota automobiles using a USB drive. The updates are saved as KWI files.",
      "KWI files' file names are a long string of numbers and letters. The last four numbers in a KWI file's name tell you what version of the Entune operating system, device driver, and/or audio the file installs. For example, a KWI file named 15TBDANA-CA01_1116.kwi will install the version UU.11.16 Entune device driver and audio."
