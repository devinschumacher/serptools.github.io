      "Mymenuify is a program Nintendo Wii gamers use to customize their Wii's menu theme. For example, gamers can change their Wii's menus to use different colors, outlines, images, animations, transparencies, and other settings. The files used to customize a Wii's menu are initially packaged within an MYM file.",
      "An MYM file is a Zip-compressed archive that contains an INI file and two BRLAN files. To transform an MYM file into a custom menu that can be installed on a Wii, gamers must download and install MyMenu.exe (packaged with Mymenuify) on their Windows PC. The gamer must then use MyMenu.exe to combine their MYM file with their Wii's .APP (Nintendo Wii WAD Archive) file, to create a CSM file.",
      "The gamer then places their CSM file on their Wii's SD card. After installing Mymenuify on their Wii, the gamer can navigate to and select their CSM file, to apply their custom theme to their Wii."
