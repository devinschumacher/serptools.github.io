      "Safe Exam Browser is an app that allows businesses and other organizations to provide online assessments to users. While a user is taking an exam via Safe Exam Browser, the app typically limits the capabilities of that user's computer, to prevent them from cheating on the exam. For example, Safe Exam Browser may show an exam in its own web browser window and prevent a user from opening other browser windows during the exam.",
      "Each Safe Exam Browser exam is associated with a SEB file, which defines that exam's settings. Test takers can double-click a SEB file to begin the associated exam (provided they have Safe Exam Browser installed)."
