      "Microsoft Small Basic is a programming language designed to help students transition from block-based coding to text-based coding. LitDev is a Small Basic extension that provides additional objects and classes programmers can add to their Small Basic programs.",
      "LitDev's LDResources class allows a developer to save their program's resources, including ImageList images, all audio files played with Sound.Play, and other resource files, in one binary file. That file is named ProgramName.sbres . The SBRES file is then used to load the program's resources when the program is executed as an .EXE file. SBRES files are typically stored in a Small Basic program's root directory, alongside their associated EXE file."
