      "In 1999, Qualcomm released the QCP format for use on mobile phones. In the past, many companies' mobile phones supported the QCP format. Primarily, the QCP format is optimized for storing voice memos. It uses variable encoding rates to take advantage of natural pauses in human speech.",
      "Sometimes, users sent QCP voice memos and ringtones as email attachments. Other users could play these files using Qualcomm's PureVoice Player-Recorder, a plug-in for email applications, and convert them to the .PCM format using Qualcomm PureVoice Converter. Both these applications have since been discontinued and are no longer available. However, there are still some applications that allow users to play and convert QCP files."
