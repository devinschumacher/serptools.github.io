      "While MO3 files are uncommon, those immersed in the music tracker scene may encounter them. Un4seen Developments created the MO3 file format to allow music tracker users to compress modules saved in the MOD format (and variants, such as .IT , .XM , .S3M , and .MTM ).",
      "Typically, music tracker users use the following encoders to compress MOD files (or other audio modules) into MO3 files:",
