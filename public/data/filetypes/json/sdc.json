      "NOTE: Secure Download Cabinet files should open automatically with UnpackSDC (unpacksdc.exe) when downloaded. This will extract and install the contents and will delete the SDC file when completed. Therefore, if the SDC file is still on your hard disk after the product has downloaded, you may need to delete the SDC file and try the process again."
