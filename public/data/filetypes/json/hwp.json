      "Hanword, formerly known as Hangul Word Processor, is part of the Hancom Office suite. The Hancom Office suite is akin to Microsoft Office, and Hanword is akin to Microsoft Word. Users who need to write documents in Korean use Hanword to create HWP files.",
      "You're most likely to encounter an HWP file while interacting with a South Korean person or organization. For example, some South Korean government agencies use documents saved as HWP files.",
      "NOTE: Hanword is included in only the Korean version of Hancom Office."
