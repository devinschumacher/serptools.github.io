      "In practice, macOS APP files are most similar to Windows .EXE files. However, while APP files behave as executable files when double-clicked, they are actually macOS packages .",
      "In macOS, you can right-click an APP file and select Show Package Contents to view the package's constituent directories and files. For example, each APP file contains a .PLIST file, which lists application properties and configuration settings. Each APP file also contains a Contents , Resources , Frameworks , and MacOS directory. The MacOS directory contains the application's actual executable file(s).",
      "NOTE: Do not edit or move an APP file's contents. Doing so can break the program the file contains."
