      "GPX files are used to exchange GPS location data, including maps, routes, and geocaching information, with others. Most commonly, fitness devices and applications, such as Garmin Connect devices, use GPX files to import and export running and biking routes. More sophisticated mapping applications, including the desktop versions of Google Earth Pro and the web version of Google Maps, also create and use GPX files.",
      "GPX files store three types of data:",
      "Mapping and fitness applications combine these three sets of data into maps and routes that they show to users."
