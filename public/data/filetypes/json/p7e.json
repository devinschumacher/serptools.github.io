      "EQStitch is an add-on that provides additional capabilities to the main Electric Quilt software. EQStitch allows you to design and digitize embroidery and machine appliqué while supporting many other embroidery machine formats.",
      "P7E files are only created with the EQStitch add-on, which requires installation of Electric Quilt version 7. Electric Quilt creates PJ7 files to store projects instead of the P7E files. However, you can export P7E projects as PJ7 projects in EQStitch by selecting File → Export Project (No Stitchings) .",
      "NOTE: P7E files can only be opened by version 7 and later of Electric Quilt with the EQStitch add-on installed."
