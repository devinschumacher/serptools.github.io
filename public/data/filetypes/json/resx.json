      "Developers commonly store application settings and program resources, such as pictures, in RESX files. If implemented correctly, this allows a developer to modify or update a program's resources without recompiling it, by swapping one RESX file for another. This can be useful when, for example, localizing programs for different regions and languages.",
      "If a RESX file contains binary data encoded as text, that text is saved within <data> </data> tags. Examples of binary data that a RESX file might contain include program properties and MIME types."
