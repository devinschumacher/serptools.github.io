      "Samsung S Memo is an application that some Samsung smartphone users use to create memos. S Memo allows users to type memos using the keypad, draw memos using the Samsung S Pen, and embed recorded audio. The memos users create in S Memo are saved as SFM files.",
      "In 2018, Samsung discontinued S Memo in favor of Samsung Notes. As of 2021, Samsung Notes saves users' notes as .SDOCX files. However, users who backed up their SFM files using their Samsung account can restore those memos in Samsung Notes."
