      "The Unreal Engine is a video game development engine published by Epic Games. Epic and other developers use Unreal Engine to create 3D video games.",
      "Games created using version 3 of the Unreal Engine often store textures in TFC files. While these games are running, they reference and apply the textures that their TFC files contain to characters, vehicles, items, and other 3D objects. For example, Rocket League contains TFC files used to skin players' vehicles."
