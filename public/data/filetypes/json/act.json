      "Various models of Chinese media players (often referred to as S1 MP3 players) and voice recorders can save audio recordings in the ACT format. This lossy format was developed by Actions Semiconductor and is usually a device's lowest-quality recording format. (Audio recorded at higher quality is typically saved as a .WAV file.)",
      "To create an ACT file, users record audio using either a device's built-in microphone or FM radio. They can then play the ACT file on their device or transfer it to their computer, where they can convert it to the WAV format using conversion software included with their device."
