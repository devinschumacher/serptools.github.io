      "Korg users typically load and play PCG files directly on their keyboard or synthesizer, but you can also view them on a computer. For example, you might create a PCG file using Korg Creator or download one from a website. You can then view it with a compatible program on your computer before transferring it to your keyboard or workstation synthesizer."
