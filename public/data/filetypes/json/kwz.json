      "Flipnote Studio 3D allows users to create stereoscopic 3D animations that can be exported in .GIF or .AVI format. It's available in Japanese, North American, and European versions. All versions of Flipnote Studio 3D save animations to 3DS users' SD cards as KWZ files. Users can also export animations made in the original Flipnote Studio app as KWZ files, using the Flipnote Studio 3D online service.",
      "The North American version of Flipnote Studio 3D saves KWZ files to the ~/​JKZE sub-directory. The Japanese version saves KWZ files to the ~/​JKZJ sub-directory; the European version saves them to the ~/​JKZP sub-directory."
