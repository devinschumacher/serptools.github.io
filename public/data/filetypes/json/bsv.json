      "High Motion Software ImBatch is a free Windows program that allows users to annotate, re-color, transform, tag, and make other adjustments to large batches of images at the same time. For example, if a professional photographer wanted to add a watermark to a large set of photos, they could load the photos in ImBatch, create a task to add the watermark, and then run the task to automatically add the watermark to all their photos.",
      "If an ImBatch user knows they'll want to run a set of tasks on additional images in the future, they can save their current task list as a BSV file. The user can then load and run the BSV file while processing other images. For example, if a photographer knows that they want to apply their watermark to additional images in the future, they could save their watermarking task as a BSV file. Then, they could load and run the file whenever they process images in ImBatch, to quickly add their watermark."
