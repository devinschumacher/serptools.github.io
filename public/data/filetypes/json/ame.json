      "ABBYY FineReader is a suite of PDF management applications that allow users to open, edit, and convert PDFs. FineReader 12 and earlier versions allow users to create custom dictionaries that are saved as AME files. These dictionaries are named for the language they are associated with (e.g. English.ame ).",
      "Users create these dictionaries using the custom dictionary tools available in each version of FineReader. For example, in FineReader 12, users create custom dictionaries by selecting Tools > View Dictionaries and then using the selections found in the User Dictionaries dialog box."
