      "After installing asciinema, developers can record their terminal sessions by entering the command asciinema rec in their terminal. When a developer finishes recording a session, asciinema saves a record of that session in a CAST file. Developers can use the CAST file to playback and review their session in their own terminal or share their session with others. By default, asciinema uploads developers' CAST files to asciinema.org and prints a hyperlink developers can use to watch and share their recorded session online.",
      "While playing a CAST file is similar to watching a screen recording, CAST files are not video files. Rather, they are timestamped, formatted records of the text typed within or printed by a terminal. When a developer uses asciinema to play a CAST file, asciinema actually creates a terminal emulator that reads and \"plays\" the text recorded in the CAST file."
