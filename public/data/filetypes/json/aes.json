      "AES files are useful for protecting sensitive personal and business documents. AES Crypt users often encrypt documents and send them via email.",
      "When AES Crypt creates an encrypted file, it append the \".aes\" extension to the filename. For example, when AES Crypt encrypts a document named mydocument.docx , it creates a new file named mydocument.docx.aes . You can double-click this file and type the password in order to access the original file.",
      "NOTE: Since AES is a common form of encryption, other encryption programs may also use the \".aes\" extension."
