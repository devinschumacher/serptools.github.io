      "BGZ files are similar to Red Eclipse's .MPZ map format and can be loaded in Red Eclipse. However, not all MPZ files can be used in Blood Frontier because of newer additions to the MPZ file format. Both BGZ and MPZ files use GZip compression.",
      "Blood Frontier and Red Eclipse are developed with the Cube 2 game engine.",
      "NOTE: The Blood Frontier project has ended. The software never reached an official release version."
