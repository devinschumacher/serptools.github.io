Users can manually create BAT files with a text editor, such as Notepad or Wordpad, and add multiple commands on separate lines that can be executed by the command-line interpreter. When saving a batch file, save it with a .bat extension or save it as a .TXT file then rename the .txt file extension as .bat ."
