      "Team Resurgent developed Repackinator to allow Xbox gamers to manage Xbox game dumps saved as ISO disc images. As part of developing Repackinator, Team Resurgent (in partnership with Team Cerbios) created the CCI, or Cerbios Compressed ISO, format.",
      "Gamers can use Repackinator to compress ISO copies of their games into CCI files. This reduces the files' size and allows gamers to store disc images more efficiently. CCI compression is based on LZ4 compression."
