      "The True Audio codec is an open-source codec that allows users to compress audio files without losing any data. This allows users to store several smaller audio files in the same amount of disk space that one larger file would take up. TTA files can contain compressed multichannel 8, 16, and 24-bit .WAV data.",
      "Because TTA files are uncommon, your operating system's default media player may not be able to play them. However, you can open TTA files using the media players listed below."
