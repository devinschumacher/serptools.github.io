      "After Effects saves projects in the AEP format by default, which loads faster and takes up less space than AEPX files. However, the AEPX format can be useful in special cases. For example, AEPX files are helpful for automation workflows, manual editing, or saving a readable project backup (you can open and modify them with a text or XML editor).",
      "To save an AEPX file, go to File → Save As → Save a Copy As XML... in After Effects. After saving, you can reopen and continue editing the project just like with a standard AEP file."
