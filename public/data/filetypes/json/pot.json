      "You will most likely only come across a POT file if you are using PowerPoint 97 through 2003 or working with someone who uses those versions of the software. If you use PowerPoint 2007 or later and save your presentation as a template it will be saved in the Open XML format with the .POTX extension.",
      "POT files come installed with PowerPoint allowing you to create presentations such as school reports, financial quarter summaries, or family photo slide shows from templates with pre-defined formatting and styles. You may also create your own custom templates for reproducing presentations specific to your needs."

      "You can open and edit POT files with Microsoft PowerPoint in Windows and macOS. PowerPoint is the best option for opening POT files because it fully supports the formatting of the template.",
      "Several other presentation programs can open POT files but they may not fully support the formatting of the template. Alternative programs include Corel Presentations (Windows), Apple Keynote (Mac), Kingsoft Presentation (multiplatform), and Apache OpenOffice Impress (multiplatform). If you are a Mac user simply looking to view a POT file, you can use Apple Preview , which comes bundled with macOS.",
      "You can also upload POT files to Google Slides , which is a free web (and mobile) application that allows you to view, edit, save, and convert the presentations."
