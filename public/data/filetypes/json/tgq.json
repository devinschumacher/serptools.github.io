      "The games that utilize TGQ video files were all released in the 1990s and are no longer developed. You most likely will not encounter a TGQ file unless you have installed the game on your computer. Some games that use TGQ files include Warcraft II: The Dark Saga, Need for Speed II, and Crusader: No Remorse."
