      "Unity is a cross-platform 3D video game development application. As a developer creates a game in Unity, they can customize Unity's game development workspace. For example, a developer can drag and dock tabs on any side of a workspace, they can add tabs to a workspace, and they can remove tabs from a workspace.",
      "After customizing their workspace in this way, developers can save their custom workspace layout settings. To do so, they open the Layout dropdown menu and then select Save Layout... . When they do, Unity saves the developer's custom layout settings in a WLT file. Unity includes several pre-created WLT files, including the Tall and Wide window layouts that developers can select from the Layout menu."
