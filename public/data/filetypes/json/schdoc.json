      "Electrical engineers and other PCB designers use Altrium Designer to mock up and test PCBs. While designing a PCB project, a designer can create one or more schematic sheets, which show that PCB project's components and connections in an easy-to-understand graphical format. These schematic sheets are saved within an SCHDOC file.",
      "If a designer wants to share their project's schematic sheets with others (e.g., for review purposes), they can export the project's SCHDOC file. Other designers can then open the SCHDOC file in Altium Designer or in one of Altium's free SCHDOC viewer applications."
