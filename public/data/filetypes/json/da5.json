      "In order to navigate through Interactive fiction games, like AGT games, you must type commands in the game. The story will change depending on what decisions you type.",
      "There are several files that are packaged with AGT games. These files contain game data and include .INS , .TTL , and .VOC files. Since there is a large amount of files that accompany the AGT game, the AGT2AGX utility that comes with AGiliTy can convert the data files into a single .AGX file. This conversion reduces clutter, load time, and game size.",
      "NOTE: The DA5 file is similar to the .DA3 , .DA4 , and .DA6 file. These files contain game data referenced for different aspects of the game."
