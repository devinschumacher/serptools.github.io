      "In old versions of Minecraft, DAT files were also used to store level \"chunks,\" which are small map pieces the game loads on-demand as a player navigates through a world. This format was introduced in the Minecraft Infdev version. The chunks used a 16 x 16 x 128 map dimension.",
      "Minecraft version 1.3's beta release introduced a new chunk format, called Region. Regions were saved in .MCR files. The MCR format was subsequently replaced by the .MCA format, also referred to as Anvil, in patch 1.2.1.",
      "NOTE: Different versions of Minecraft use differently-formatted DAT files. Therefore, a DAT file produced by one version of the game may not be compatible with other versions."
