      "TurboTax is a U.S. tax preparation and filing application. It is available as a downloadable desktop version for Windows and macOS or as a web version called TurboTax Online.",
      "The desktop version creates TAX2021 files when you save your tax return with TurboTax 2021 by selecting File â†’ Save... . Because TurboTax 2021 does not save TAX21 files by default, they are uncommon."
