      "7-Zip is a file manager and archiving application available for Windows. While users can configure 7-Zip to show UI messages in other languages, the program's default language is English. The default strings 7-Zip uses to show English messages are saved in the file en.ttt .",
      "En.ttt is stored in 7-Zip's Lang directory, along with the plain text files that contain the program's other localized UI messages. However, en.ttt is the only file in the Lang directory that uses the TTT extension. Other languages' files use the .TXT extension."
