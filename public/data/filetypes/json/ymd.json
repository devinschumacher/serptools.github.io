      "Developer shiru8bit, also known as Shiru, has created and maintains several chiptune music trackers that emulate obscure music engines and sound cards. Shiru's Yach*PMS emulates MuzCell, a sound board used by a Soviet-created clone of the Apple IIc computer.",
      "In Yach*PMS, users can create multi-channel chiptune audio (including up to six tone channels and up to two percussion channels) that sounds as though it were being played by the MuzCell sound board. They can then save these songs as YMD files, to continue editing them at a later time, or export them as .WAV files, for use in other audio players and editors."
