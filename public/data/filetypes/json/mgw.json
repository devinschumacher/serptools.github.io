      "You will most likely only encounter MGW files if you enjoy playing retro Nintendo Game & Watch games. The game files are often acquired by gamers by downloading them from a retro gamer site. Gamers may also share games with each other via email.",
      "The lr-gw simulator allows you to play games stored in MGW files. It works similar to an emulator but since the MGW files store recreation of games instead of the actual game data, it is considered a simulator.",
      "NOTE: The Nintendo Game & Watch is a series of handheld electronic games developed by Nintendo from 1980-1991 that was succeeded by the Game Boy. The \"MGW\" acronym comes from the \"Mr. Game & Watch\" character, which is a combination of characters from the Game & Watch series."
