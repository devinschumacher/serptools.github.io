      "The SFO files save custom configurations that streamline users' repeated searches by reducing the need for manual input each time a user looks for specific files. Additionally, the SFO file type is proprietary to CuteFTP, and other FTP programs do not support it.",
      "NOTE: GlobalSCAPE released CuteFTP in 1996, becoming popular among web developers, IT professionals, and businesses transferring files between local computers and remote servers via FTP, SFTP, and FTPS. However, with the rise of cloud-based storage and alternative FTP clients, its usage has declined, though some individuals and businesses still use it for specific FTP workflows."
