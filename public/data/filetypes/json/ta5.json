      "The TA5 file is most often created during 2016 since annual tax returns are filed for the previous year. A TA5 file can be saved by the desktop version of TaxAct or exported from TaxAct Online. Once you have completed a tax return, you can either print and mail the tax forms or file electronically.",
      "TA5 files prepared by TaxAct desktop users (Free Federal, Basic, Plus, and Premium) are located in the \"TaxAct2015\" folder in your \"My Documents\" folder."
