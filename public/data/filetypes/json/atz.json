      "Atomic Time Zone is a program developed to provide accurate times based on International Atomic Time (TAI) for different time zones worldwide. The program is discontinued and unavailable for download, making ATZ files extremely rare. However, you can find the ATZ file in the Atomic Time Zone installation directory if you have installed the program on your computer."
