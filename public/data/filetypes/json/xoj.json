      "Xournal is a notetaking application, available for Linux and Windows, that simulates a real-life notebook. Xournal users can take notes, doodle, insert images, and even highlight and annotate their text, just as they would when using a real notebook.",
      "Each Xournal notebook (which may consist of any number of pages) is saved within a XOJ file. If Xournal users want to share their notebook(s) with another Xournal user, they can do so by giving that user their XOJ file(s).",
      "NOTE: XOJ files can also be opened in Xournal++, a cross-platform variant of Xournal."
