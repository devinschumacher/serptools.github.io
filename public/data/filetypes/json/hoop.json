      "In August 2021, some PC users began reporting that their computers had been infected a new variant of STOP ransomware. This variant encrypts users' files and appends them with the .hoop extension. The ransomware then produces a plain text ransom note named _readme.txt . The note contains instructions users are meant to follow to decrypt their files.",
      "HOOP ransomware is most commonly distributed within \"free programs\" that are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed a \"free program\" (especially one that is meant to be a copy of a paid program) from a software download website, that may be how your computer became infected by HOOP ransomware.",
      "NOTE: To learn more about STOP ransomware and its variants, refer to the .STOP entry."
