      "Drive Snapshot is a simple backup utility developed by Tom Ehlert. It allows users to create backups of their Windows drives, which they can use to restore those drives (if the drive becomes damaged or corrupted) or retrieve previous versions of those drives' contents.",
      "Primarily, Drive Snapshot saves the backups it creates as SNA files. Users can load SNA files in Drive Snapshot to browse their contents, retrieve files from the backup, and restore the backup's contents.",
      "However, if a being-backed-up drive's contents are large enough, Drive Snapshot splits the drive's contents among multiple backup files: a primary SNA file and one or more backup continuation files. These continuation files use the same filename as the SNA file, but the .sn1 , .sn2 , etc. extensions. To retrieve files from or restore a backup that includes continuation files, you must possess the backup's SNA file and all of its continuation files."
