      "LiveSplit allows video game speedrunners to time their progress through a video game, a section of a video game, or an in-game challenge. Speedrunners can divide their progress into sub-sections, referred to as splits, that represent specific levels or goals. For example, a gamer trying to complete Terraria in record time might divide the game into sub-sections that reflect how long it took to defeat each of the game's bosses. Each boss-based split would then appear and be timed separately in LiveSplit (along with the speedrunner's overall time).",
      "If a speedrunner wants to load a set of pre-set splits into LiveSplit, they can do so using an LSS file. LSS files are XML files that define splits for a specific game or challenge. For example, when a speedrunner takes part in an online challenge, they may have to download that challenge's LSS file, load it in LiveSplit, and use it to time their speedrun."
