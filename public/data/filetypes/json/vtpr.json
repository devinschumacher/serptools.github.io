When a VTPR file is opened in Studio Store Visualizer, the program loads the information in the 3DW file. VTPR and the lined 3DW file should be located in the same folder. Also, if you share a VTPR file with another user, you must include the linked 3DW file and any linked .L3DW external library files, or else you will not be able to visualize the product in the 3D environment."
