      "QVD database files are used to store data for business sales, revenue, costs, and profits. The data is used for competitive intelligence and historical, current, and predictive analysis.",
      "When a QVD file is open, QlikView houses the database in memory instead of on disk, which allows for fast data queries and computation. Therefore, QVD files are loaded directly into memory when opened in the software."
