      "Pencil2D is a free 2D animation program available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Animators use Pencil2D to create and export animated movies, which are saved as .MP4 or .GIF files. Animators can also export specific frames from their movies as .PNG , .JPG , .BMP , or .TIFF files.",
      "When an animator saves a Pencil2D project, the project is saved as a PCLX file. The PCLX file is a compressed file that contains a main.xml file, which Pencil2D uses to open and load the project, as well as a data folder. The data folder contains additional XML files, PNG files representing each of a movie's frames, and any .WAV or other audio files that have been added to the movie's Sound Layer.",
      "NOTE: Pencil2D previously saved users' projects as PCL files."
