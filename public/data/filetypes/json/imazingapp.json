      "iMazing is a Windows and Mac application that iPhone users can use to back up all or some of the data stored on their iPhones. If a user wants to back up only the data used by a specific iPhone app, they can open iMazing and select Manage Apps . The user then selects the app for which they want to back up their data, opens iMazing's dropdown menu, and selects Back Up App Data .",
      "iMazing then saves the user's user-specific app data in an IMAZINGAPP file. IMAZINGAPP files contain only a user's app data; they do not contain a copy of the app from which they were created. iMazing can, however, use IMAZINGAPP file's to re-install associated apps, as a user restores the data their IMAZINGAPP file contains."
