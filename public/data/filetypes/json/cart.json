      "BrickLink is an online marketplace in which LEGO fans can buy and sell LEGO sets, bricks, minifigures, and other elements. To buy items, a user selects the items they want from different BrickLink merchants, each of whom has their own store. The items are then added to the user's shopping cart.",
      "If a user wants to export the contents of their shopping cart, for use later or to share with another user, they can do so by selecting one or more categories in their cart and clicking the Export button. BrickLink will then export those categories' contents, including the items the user added to their cart and the store(s) from which the user added them."
