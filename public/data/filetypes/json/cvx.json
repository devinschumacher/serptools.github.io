      "Canvas X Pro, Canvas X Draw, and Canvas X Geo specialize in creating and editing technical illustrations and specialized visualizations. Examples of drawings you can create with Canvas X applications include room floorplans, workflow diagrams for a project, and a public park (with its geospatial data).",
      "ACD Systems introduced CVX files when they released version 9 of Canvas in 2003. In later years, ACD Systems split the Canvas application into several standalone applications, including Canvas X Pro, Canvas X Draw, and Canvas X Geo. In 2017, ACD Systems shifted the development of Canvas X software to Canvas GFX.",
      "While Canvas X Draw (Windows version) and Canvas X still save drawings as CVX files by default, GeoCanvas X Pro saves drawings in the .CVXCAD format (but can still save drawings as CVX files).",
      "You can create CVX files with Canvas X Draw and Geo by selecting File â†’ Save As... , then choosing CVX - Canvas from the \"Save as type\" dropdown menu (should be set as this type, by default)."
