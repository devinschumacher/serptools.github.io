      "PRVX files are saved in a proprietary format developed by SoftMaker Software. But they are similar to .POTX templates created by Microsoft PowerPoint, which is a popular slide presentation program included with Microsoft Office. PRVX files may be converted to various formats in Presentations, including .PPT , .PPTX , .PDF , .HTML , .PNG , .JPG , .TIF , .BMP , .WMV , .MP4 and .RTF .",
      "You can create a PRVX file by selecting File → Save or Save as , and then choosing the PRVX format. You can open a PRVX file by selecting File → Open and navigating to the PRVX file. You can also choose File → New and select the template from which you want to create your new document. PRVX files are saved by default in the \"Designs [version]\" folder of the \"SoftMaker\" folder in your \"Documents\" folder path.",
      "NOTE: PRVX files replaced .PRV files as the primary file type used to store templates in Presentations."
