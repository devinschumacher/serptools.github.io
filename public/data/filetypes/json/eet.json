      ".ESP and .ESM files are game data and plug-in files often used to mod Skyrim, Fallout, and other Bethesda video games. Many of these files contain only English text, which can make them difficult for non-English readers to use.",
      "ESP/ESM Translator allows gamers to translate ESP and ESM mods' text into other languages. To do so, the gamer must first acquire or create an EET file, which is a translation database that contains multiple languages' versions of game-related text. For example, an EET file might contain multiple copies of a game's dialog and menu text written in different languages.",
      "After a gamer acquires an EET file for a game, they can attempt to automatically translate ESP and ESM mods using the EET file and ESP/ESM Translator. Gamers can also manually write translations and store them in an EET file. Then, they can apply those translations to a mod's text."
