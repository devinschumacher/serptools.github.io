      "In 1991, Apple released QTFF, which eventually led to the formation of the MPEG-4 standard. Apple designed QTFF to support various media types to accommodate the transfer of multimedia between applications, operating systems, and devices.",
      "Video files saved in QTFF may use the .qt or .mov file extensions but .MOV files are much more common than QT files. Since MOV and QT files often store video compressed with the MPEG-4 codec, they are commonly interchanged with .MP4 video files.",
      "QTFF is object-oriented and forward-compatible, allowing it to support new object types introduced over time. In addition, the format supports media data, which is the video, audio, or text data, and metadata . The metadata includes the media compression utilized, timing information, the number of media tracks, and an index of the media data location."
