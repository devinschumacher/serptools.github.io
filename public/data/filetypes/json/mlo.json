      "Monect PC Remote is a mobile app that allows a user to use their Android or iOS device as a controller for their PC. Primarily, gamers use PC Remote to emulate gaming controllers on their smartphones. However, PC Remote users can also turn their devices into PC keyboards or touchpads.",
      "To customize PC Remote for use with specific types of games (or other PC apps), users can create and apply custom layouts. For example, a user's custom layout might be optimized for playing racing games on their PC, and include steering wheel, accelerator, and brake controls. These layouts are saved as MLO files.",
      "Each MLO file is a Zip-compressed file that contains the layout's XML schema and graphics assets. After creating an MLO file, users can upload the file to Monect's forums, to share it with other PC Remote users.",
      "NOTE: To use Monect PC Remote, you must install the app on both your Windows PC and your mobile device."
