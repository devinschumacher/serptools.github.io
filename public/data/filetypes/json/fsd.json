      "The COCO simulation environment consists of several components and utilities that allow you to model chemical processes. One of the components is the CAPE-OPEN Flowsheet Environment (COFE), which is a GUI to chemical flowsheeting and allows you to save and open FSD files. FSD files can also be used as CAPE-OPEN unit operations, which means you can use them inside COFE or other simulators."
