      "PNC files are created when images are recorded by a Panasonic network camera and downloaded to its SD card. You can configure the camera settings for how PNC files are captured including the image resolution and the frequency of images captured.",
      "The PNC images can be transferred to a computer using the camera's SD card. You can download the free Panasonic SD Viewer and use it to view the PNC files. You can also use the program to save the image to a more common format, such as JPEG, GIF, or PNG."
