      "Assignment files are created using InDesign and then assigned to a specific editor, who has permission to edit page content using InCopy. Once the page is complete, the editor notifies the sender. This process is useful in several ways:",
      "INCA files are exported with INCX linked content files, which contain the text, graphics, and frames to be modified. Editors typically access INCA and INCX files over a network.",
      "NOTE: INCA files have been replaced by .ICMA files in InDesign and InCopy CS4 and later."
