      "You can find HDS files within an HDD hard drive file, which itself is saved inside the .PVM or .MACVM VM file. To view the files within an HDS file, you must mount its enclosing HDD file with Parallels Mounter, a program included with Parallels Desktop. You can accomplish this by following these instructions:",
      "If you do not see the Parallels Mounter.app in the list of programs to open the HDD file, you can find it in the /​Library/​Parallels/​ directory on your hard drive."
