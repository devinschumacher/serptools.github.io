      "The BeamNG engine specializes in simulating the physics of car crashes. The driving simulation game BeamNG.Drive prominently uses JBEAM files for its vehicles.",
      "Most BeamNG.Drive gamers will likely only encounter JBEAM files if they attempt to alter vehicles' appearance and capabilities in the game. For example, a gamer may modify the properties in a JBEAM file and place it back in the appropriate vehicle folder for the game to display the changes to the vehicle.",
      "NOTE: You can find the folders for official vehicles in the following directory:",
