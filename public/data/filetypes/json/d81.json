      "The now-discontinued Commodore 64 supported various storage devices for transferring data. Supported devices include floppy disks, magnetic tape datasettes, and cartridges. Commodore 64 enthusiasts dump the game or program data from these devices and save them in different file formats (depending on the device from which they were dumped) to later run with an emulator.",
      "D81 is one of many formats utilized to store Commodore 64 games or programs. Other formats created by Commodore 64 enthusiasts include .D64 , .G41 , .T64 , .D71 , and .X64 ."
