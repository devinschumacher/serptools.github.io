      "Adobe developed the SVGZ format to reduce the size of SVG files, which is helpful when transferring SVG graphics online. SVGZ files are typically 50 to 80 percent smaller in size than uncompressed SVG files.",
      "Graphics professionals often use SVGZ files to transfer SVG graphics to share with other professionals. Also, web designers utilize SVGZ files to share SVG graphics with other designers, which are widely supported by web browsers."
