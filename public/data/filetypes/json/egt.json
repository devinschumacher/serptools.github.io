      "NOTE: EGT files are not meant to be opened, if you find an EGT file and you are not currently downloading a file, then the download has most likely been disrupted and you'll have to download the file again. However, you can try renaming the \"egt\" extension to the correct file extension. For example, a downloaded .MP4 file may appear with the \"egt\" extension but if you rename it to \"mp4,\" the file may become playable."
