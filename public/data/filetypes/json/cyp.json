      "Ashampoo's architectural CAD programs allow users to create and share home design plans with others. These plans, which may contain virtual floor plans, framing, roofs, windows, doors, kitchens, bathrooms, and other features, are saved as CYP files. Users can also use CYP files to calculate their proposed home's dimensions and conduct virtual home tours.",
      "NOTE: Many of the building components CYP files contain are stored in .CYG files."
