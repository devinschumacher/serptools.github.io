      "The International Color Consortium was created in 1993 with the purpose of establishing and maintaining an open color management system for seamless colors across devices, operating systems, and documents. The ICC color profile format was developed to help users match the colors on a computer screen to the colors in printed and scanned documents.",
      "ICC files can be imported by various image-editing programs, such as Adobe Photoshop and CorelDRAW. They can also be opened by Microsoft Color Control Panel in Windows and Apple ColorSync Utility in macOS."
