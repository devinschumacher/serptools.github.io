      "In HaxBall , players face off in simplistic-looking 2D soccer matches. While playing or watching a HaxBall match, a user can select Menu → Rec to start recording that match. When the user is done recording, they can select Menu → Rec again to save their recording as an HBR2 file.",
      "HaxBall includes an HBR2 player, which users can access by selecting Replays from the game's Room list screen. Additionally, enterprising HaxBall enthusiasts have created several custom replay utilities, including custom players and replay analyzers.",
      "NOTE: Prior to the introduction of the HBR2 format, HaxBall replays were saved as HBR ( .hbr ) files."
