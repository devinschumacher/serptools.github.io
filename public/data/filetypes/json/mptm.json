      "OpenMPT is short for Open ModPlug Tracker and is based on the original ModPlug Tracker. Olivier Lapicque initially developed the software and released it in 1997, then released its code as open source. A group of programmers and musicians now develop the software.",
      "The application supports various sample and instrument audio formats such as .MDL , .STM , WAV, and PAT, but saves modules in its native MPTM format by default. You can create an MPTM by selecting File → New → OpenMPT Module , modifying the module, then selecting File → Save or Save As... . After saving the MPTM file, you can close the module, and re-open it for further editing."
