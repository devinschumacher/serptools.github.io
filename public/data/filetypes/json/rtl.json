      "The HP-RTL is a subset of the Printer Command Language (PCL) page description language. It is a raster based language that is designed to mix with the HP-GL/2 vector based language in order to embed bitmap images into HP-GL/2 print jobs for creating different parts of the same image.",
      "The Arcpress printer engine, which is utilized by ArcGIS to print maps, features the HP Universal, HP RTL (RGB) TrueColor, and HP RTL (CMYK Color/B&W) Halftone drivers. Each of these drivers supports the RTL format. Overall, a variety of large format printers from different companies support the HP-RTL language."
