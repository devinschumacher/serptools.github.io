      "Sokoban is a Japanese puzzle game originally published in December 1982. The game involves pushing crates around a warehouse to different spots in the labyrinth. Sokoban has spawned multiple variants, such as Sokoban++, Rokoban, and PuzzleField.",
      "You can open an SLC file with Sokoban-variants, such as Sokoban++ or PuzzleField, by first opening the program then simply dragging and dropping the file into the program. After opening the SLC file, you will be able to play the collection of levels contained in the file.",
      "NOTE: Since the SLC file stores information in XML format, you can open and edit the file with any plain text or XML editor."
