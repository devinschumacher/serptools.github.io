      "Comments are explanatory lines of text that are ignored when a program parses a source code or data file. By default, the .JSON format does not support comments. However, because comments can be useful for explaining why a file is structured the way it is, various developers have sought to add comment support to JSON. These developers typically call the resulting format JSONC, or JSON With Comments.",
      "For example, Microsoft Visual Studio Code includes a JSON With Comments mode, which is used primarily to edit the program's configuration files. This allows users to add single line ( // ) or block ( /* */ ) comments. Developers Michael Gross and Muhammad Muzzail have also developed their own JSONC formats, which use similar implementations."
