      "Locklizard Safeguard PDF Security is a Windows application that allows companies to encrypt and copy-protect PDF documents, so unauthorized users cannot view, modify, print, or take screenshots of the documents' contents. Safeguard PDF Security saves these protected PDF files as PDC files.",
      "Each PDC file is encrypted using AES 256-bit encryption and Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) controls, which specify how authorized users can open the file, as well as what actions they can take after opening the file. Within a company, PDC files are often locked to specific users or devices. When sent outside a company, a PDC file is typically accompanied by an LLV file, which is a license file that allows the user who received the PDC file to open it with Locklizard Safeguard PDF Viewer."
