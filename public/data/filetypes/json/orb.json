      "ORB files are compressed with Zip compression and contain .SWF files that make up the eBook. If you come across an ORB file you can open it with Original Book Reader, which is available for Windows and macOS. You can also manually view the contents of an ORB file by renaming the \".orb\" extension to the \".zip\" extension and then extracting the contents with a Zip utility."
