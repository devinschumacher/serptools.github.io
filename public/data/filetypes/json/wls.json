      "Renault developed the R-Link Toolbox program to help you manage products you have purchased and downloaded from the R-Link store. The program also helps you download free updates (WLS files) and place them onto an SD card or USB stick, which can be connected to the R-Link tablet to transfer and install updates.",
      "R-Link connects to the Renault vehicle, smartphone, and the Internet. It comes with a large amount of apps installed and allows you to purchase and install more using an R-Link store account."
