      "Although relocation tables are often generated by compilers, they may not be needed and therefore unnecessarily increase the executable file size. You can use the program StripReloc to remove RELOC files from executables.",
      "NOTE: You can use 7-Zip to open an EXE file and view the included RELOC file, if it exists for that executable."
