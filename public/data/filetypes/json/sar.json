      "SAP is an ERP suite that allows businesses to centralize their data and business logic. Versions 4.6C and above of SAP include a proprietary compression utility named SAPCAR. (In previous versions, this utility was named just CAR.)",
      "SAPCAR creates and can extract files from compressed archives saved as SAR files. Often, IT administrators provide SAR files that contain additional or updated programs to end-users, so those users can install the programs on their machine."
