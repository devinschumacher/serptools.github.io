      "The Android thumbnail file is generated automatically when an SD card containing images is loaded on an Android device. It is typically named SThumbDB.tdb and is not meant to be opened manually. The file is often hidden, but may be displayed if hidden files are viewable. It may also appear if you mount the SD card on a computer or other non-Android device."
