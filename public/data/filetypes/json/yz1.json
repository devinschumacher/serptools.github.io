      "Satoshi Yamazaki developed the YZ1 archive format. It was the default format in which the Yamazaki ZIPPER and Deep Freezer utilities (now discontinued Windows applications) compressed files, often text documents.",
      "Since many compression utilities no longer support the format, the format is obscure. However, you may still encounter an old YZ1 archive on your computer or receive one from another Windows user."
