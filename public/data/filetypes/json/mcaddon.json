      "The MCPACK and MCWORLD files stored in MCADDON files are typically used to alter gameplay or the Minecraft UI . They may add worlds to the game, alter graphics, modify characters, or optimize graphics.",
      "MCADDON files are created manually by users that want to distribute multiple MCPACK or MCWORLD files online. In order to create a MCADDON file, compress your MCPACK or MCWORLD files as a .ZIP file then rename the extension from \".zip\" to \".mcaddon\".",
      "Since MCADDON files are compressed with Zip compression, they can be expanded using a Zip decompression utility. Simply rename the \".mcaddon\" extension to \".zip\" and use a zip decompression program to expand the contents. Some Zip programs include Corel WinZip, 7-Zip, Apple Archive Utility, or ES File Explorer."
