      "WinAce was an archiving and encryption utility available for Windows. Primarily, it allowed users to package one or more files within compressed archives. By default, WinAce saved these archives in its proprietary ACE format.",
      "E-merge discontinued WinAce in the 2000s. The last version of the program is WinAce 2.69, which was released in 2007."
