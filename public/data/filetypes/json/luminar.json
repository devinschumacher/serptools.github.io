      "Luminar is a digital photo-editing application that allows photographers to make layer-based edits to their photos. Luminar 4 saves in-progress edits within Luminar catalogs, which are folders comprised of STATE files, TIFF files, and a LUMINAR file, among others.",
      "The LUMINAR file is a SQLite database that Luminar uses to retrieve the TIFF and STATE files stored within a catalog and associate them with one another, so edited images appear correctly within Luminar. Note that, while you can use a LUMINAR file to open a Luminar catalog (as described below), LUMINAR files are not, themselves, catalogs. For example, if you move a LUMINAR file and then attempt to use it to open a Luminar catalog, Luminar will show an error message that says the catalog you are attempting to open cannot be found."
