      "MixPad supports audio recording as well as audio import from over 30 file formats.",
      "NOTE: MixPad saves references to audio files rather than the audio data itself. A directory named myproject.mpdp.ProjectData is created in the same directory as the project file and stores the audio. Therefore, if you need to transport an audio project, you'll need to transfer this directory as well."
