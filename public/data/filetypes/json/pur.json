      "PureRef allows creatives to collect and organize many reference images in a single workspace, referred to as a scene. To add an image to a scene, a user drags and drops the image into PureRef. The user can then organize their images, drag and drop them from PureRef into another app, and annotate the images to, for example, note specific details they want to reference.",
      "If a user wants to save a PureRef scene for later use, they can do so by selecting Menu → Save → Save from the program's menu bar. PureRef will then save the scene as a PUR file. Depending on a user's settings, the PUR file will either contain all the user's images (default) or contain a list of file paths used to load the images from other locations."
