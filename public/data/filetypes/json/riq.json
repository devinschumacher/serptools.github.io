      "Heaven Studio is a fan-made recreation of Rhythm Heaven that includes a custom level editor. Using the level editor, players can create their own levels, referred to as remixes. They can then play those remixes in Heaven Studio.",
      "Each Heaven Studio remix is saved as an RIQ file. This file is a ZIP archive that contains two files: a JSON file describing a level's beats per minute, volume, properties, and rhythm prompts, and an audio file that contains the level's music. When opened in Heaven Studio's level editor, RIQ files appear as timeline-based level creation projects, which chart a level's prompts across one or more color-coded tracks."
