      "You most likely will only encounter a BA9 file if you file your taxes with TaxAct 2019 software. Each annual release of TaxAct uses a different extension for backup files. For example, a tax return backup file created by TaxAct 2017 uses the .ba7 extension, while TaxAct 2018 creates backup files with the .ba8 file extension. BA9 files may be created manually by a user or automatically generated by TaxAct 2019.",
      "To manually save a backup of your tax return with TaxAct 2019, select File → Backup... and name your file. You must save your tax return as a TA9 file before creating your backup. To restore a backup in TaxAct 2019, select File → Restore Backup... and navigate to the location of your BA9 file.",
      "TaxAct 2019 automatically generates three types of BA9 tax return backup files and stores them in the \"AUTO-BACKUP\" folder. The three types are the current backup, a daily backup, and a weekly backup. You can tell the type from the filename. For example, the daily BA9 backup file for a 2019 tax return is .ta9_daily.ba9 ."
