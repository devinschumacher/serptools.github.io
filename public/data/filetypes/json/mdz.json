      "Microsoft Access is a relational database management system ( RDBMS ) available for Windows. It allows users to create databases and connect them to applications, which can read, display, and edit the database's data.",
      "Typically, Access users create new databases from a related Access database template. (Alternatively, users can create a blank database.) In versions of Access prior to 2007, these templates were saved as MDZ files. However, in Access 2007 and later versions, MDZ files have been replaced by .ACCDT files (just as .MDB files have been replaced by .ACCDB files)."
