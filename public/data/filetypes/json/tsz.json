      "Trillian is a multiplatform IM application that is used by individuals and businesses. It allows users to connect to and chat across multiple IM services. Healthcare organizations, for example, use Trillian to conduct secure, intraorganizational chats.",
      "In previous versions, Trillian allowed users to install skins that changed the program's appearance. These skins are saved in TSZ files. Each TSZ file is a Zip-compressed package that contains all the assets needed to alter Trillian's appearance. This includes .BMP , .PNG ., and/or .JPG images and .XML files.",
      "NOTE: Some Trillian skins are saved as normal .ZIP files."
