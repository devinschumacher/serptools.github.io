      "In the Struts framework, the .do extension is a URL mapping scheme for a web application and not a file extension. For example, Struts often uses the .do string for mapping Java servlet actions to a Struts servlet (typically in the web.xml configuration file).",
      "Additionally, DO files downloaded from a web browser are typically data files, most often .PDF files, such as bank statements or other documents. Some webinar programs may also generate DO files formatted as .VCS files. Changing the file extension to the correct extension ( .vcs in this case) may allow you to import the files into programs that support the VCS format."
