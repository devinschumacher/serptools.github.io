      "Discord is a text, voice, and video chat program that provides gamers and other social communities with a place to hang out online. Discord contains a series of public and private servers, organized by topic, that users can join to chat with their friends, host a virtual game night, or express their devotion to their favorite sports teams.",
      "Advanced users can create and add bots to their Discord servers. These bots perform various functions, such as automatically welcoming new members to a server, moderating content, and rewarding a server's most active members. Scratch for Discord allows developers to create these types of bots within a block-based development environment.",
      "As a developer is working on a bot in Scratch for Discord, they can save their progress in an S4D file. S4D files can be used to load an in-process Scratch for Discord project, run a bot through Scratch for Discord (by selecting the Run button found in the program's upper right-hand corner), or download a bot in order to host it on your own computer or Virtual Private Server."
