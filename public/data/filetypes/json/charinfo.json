      "Miis are avatars and NPCs that appear in some Nintendo video games. For example, the Switch games Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Miitopia all contain Miis that players can play as.",
      "These Nintendo Switch Miis are saved in the CHARINFO file format. Typically, CHARINFO files are saved with the .charinfo file extension. However, some CHARINFO files (such as those found in Mario Golf: Super Rush) are instead saved with the .mii extension.",
      "NOTE: The website MiiLibrary provides copies of some official CHARINFO files."
