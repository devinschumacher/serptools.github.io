      "PGM files include a header that defines the PGM format type (\"P2\" for text or \"P5\" for binary), image width and height, and the maximum number of shades. While binary PGM files may contain multiple images, ASCII PGM files may only include one image.",
      "The PGM format is one of several image formats defined by the Netpbm project, which is an open-source package of graphics programs. Other formats include the portable bitmap ( .PBM ) and portable pixmap ( .PPM ) formats.",
      "NOTE: PGM files may also be called \"portable greymap\" files."
