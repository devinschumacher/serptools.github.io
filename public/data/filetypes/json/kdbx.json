      "KeePass is a password management application that allows users to catalog all their logins and passwords in a single database. That way, users can refer to the database whenever they need to remember any of their login information.",
      "Version 2 of KeePass stores users' login credentials in a KDBX database file. The KDBX format replaced KeePass 1's .KDB format. However, KeePass 2 can still import KDB databases and export databases as KDB files.",
      "NOTE: The Mac and Linux version of KeePass, called KeePassX, does not yet support the KDBX format."
