      "Fusion is virtualization software that allows you to run Windows and Linux operating systems (OSes) on a Mac. When you add an OS to Fusion, the app creates a virtual machine (VM) and saves it as a VMWAREVM file.",
      "To create a VMWAREVM file, select File â†’ New... or click + in the Virtual Machine Library window. You can then choose to install an OS from a disc or image, recovery partition, Boot Camp, or import an existing virtual machine, which includes Parallels Virtual Machine ( .PVM ) files."
