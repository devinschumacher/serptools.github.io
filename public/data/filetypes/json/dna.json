      "GSL Biotech SnapGene is a molecular biology program that documents, designs, and simulates DNA sequences. When you save a DNA sequence, the software creates a DNA file to store the contents.",
      "To create a DNA file with SnapGene, follow these steps:",
      "After creating the DNA file, you can save it by selecting File â†’ Save or Save As... . Then, after saving the file, you can close it and re-open it to modify the sequence further."
