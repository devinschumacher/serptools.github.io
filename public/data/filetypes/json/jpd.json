      "The BEA WebLogic Integration standard provides tools for creating and managing business processes within enterprise applications. Developers and system integrators are the primary users of JPD files since they create them to configure the design of business workflows.",
      "For example, a business requires an automated process for handling custom orders. A developer uses a tool, like WebLogic Workshop, to design the workflow for the process where each step in the workflow (e.g., validating an order, checking inventory, and then processing a payment) is defined in the JPD file, specifying what actions to perform and the transitions between steps. The developer then deploys the JPD file to the WebLogic server, which follows the process laid out in the JPD file when a customer places an order online.",
      "NOTE: While BEA WebLogic Integration has been incorporated into Oracle Fusion Middleware, users may still encounter JPD files in legacy systems or older enterprise applications."
