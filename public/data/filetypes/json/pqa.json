      "Various Palm OS applications store information in PDB files, which are local database files. PQA files are PDB files that contain not only local data, but data retrieved from the Internet at the time the database is opened. While PDB files are typically opened using whatever application created them, PQA files are always opened using the Palm OS Web Clipping Application Viewer. PQA files are created using the Web Clipping Application builder.",
      "NOTE: With the release of version 4 of Palm OS, Palm began referring to PQA files as Web Clipping Applications and WCA files. However, the files continued to use the .pqa file extension."
