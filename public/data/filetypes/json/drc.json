      "In 2003, BBC Research & Development created a prototype video compression format designed to be used with high definition video. This format and its various implementations are called Dirac. BBC R&D finalized the Dirac format in 2008, and the BBC used the format to transmit video internally during the 2008 Summer Olympics.",
      "While Dirac videos are more commonly saved using the .AVI , .OGG , .MKV , and .MP4 extensions, some are saved as DRC files. In the past, VLC media player was able to open and play DRC files. However, at some point after November 2008, VLC media player stopped supporting DRC videos."
