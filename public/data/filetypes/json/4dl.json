      "Multiple 4DL files are often saved along with a 4DD file. For example, a database named \"db1.4dd\" may generate an initial log file named \"db1[0001-0000].4dl.\" If the database has bee saved 5 times, the program will generate a log file named \"db1[0005-0000].\" If the log file itself is then saved 3 times, it will be named \"db1[0005-0003].4dl.\""
