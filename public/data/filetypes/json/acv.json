      "Photoshop's Curves tool allows you to modify an image's colors using either a default or custom color adjustment curve. Most of these curves are saved as ACV files. (Curves drawn using the Curves tool's freehand setting are saved as .AMP files.)",
      "The default ACV files Photoshop includes are saved in its Presets/​Curves directory. To create your own ACV file:",
      "This will save your custom curve as an ACV file, in your user-specific Presets/​Curves directory."
