      "SCSKIN files are often shared between different Survivalcraft users to modify the characters in the game. You can place the file in the Survivalcraft game directory with the other SCSKIN files to use it in the game. You can also rename the \".scskin\" extension to \".png\" and view it in an image editor that supports the PNG format.",
      "SCSKIN files are used for all types of characters, such as men, women, monsters, slendermen, and clowns. They are commonly 64 x 64 pixels in size."
