      "The CWA format is an open source format developed by Axivity for the purpose of recording data for human movement studies. The sensors in the Axivity device, such as an AX3 or AX6, record the movements of the person wearing the device and the device stores the data in the CWA format. Users can then transfer the data from the device as CWA files onto their computer, then analyze the data with software that supports the CWA format",
      "Open Movement OMGUI is an open source program for Windows that can be used to open CWA files and analyze their data. The program can also export the data to more common file formats, such as .WAV and .CSV .",
      "NOTE: Axivity is based in the United Kingdom."
