      "The ART50 format is the native file type used by version 5 of BERNINA ARTlink to save designs that can be re-opened and modified by the software. When finished with the design, you can export it to an embroidery format supported by the sewing machine to stitch the design onto a quilt, shirt, or another piece of fabric.",
      "To do this with BERNINA ARTlink, select File â†’ Export Machine File... , then choose the format. Conversion options include .ART , .EXP , .PES , .JEF , .SEW , .PEC , .VP3 , .VIP , .HUS , and .SHV .",
      "After converting the design, insert a USB storage device in your computer, then transfer the converted design file from your computer to the connected storage device via File Explorer in Windows or Finder in macOS. After transferring the file, eject the storage device from your computer and insert it into the sewing machine to transfer the design to the machine and embroider it onto the material.",
      "NOTE: Beginning with version 5 of ARTlink, the software saves designs with file extensions that reflect the version of the software. For example, ARTlink 6 saves designs as .ART60 files, and ARTlink 7 saves designs as .ART70 files."
