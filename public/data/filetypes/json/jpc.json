      "The Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) committee developed the JPEG 2000 standard in the late-1990s to replace the JPEG standard released in 1992. It provides several improvements over the JPEG format, including an advanced compression algorithm. However, the JPEG format is still the preferred image format.",
      "There is no standard file extension for the JPEG 2000 Code Stream format since it is primarily delivered via code stream online instead of in a file format. However, files may still store JPEG 2000 Code Stream data. These file typically use the .jpc or .j2c ( .J2C files) file extensions."
