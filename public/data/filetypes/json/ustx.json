      "StAkira created OpenUTAU to be an open-source successor to UTAU, a vocal synthesizer similar to YAMAHA's VOCALOID and VOCALOID2 software. UTAU saves vocaloid sequences as .UST files whereas OpenUTAU saves sequences as USTX files. While UTAU does not support USTX files, OpenUTAU supports UST and USTX files.",
      "You can save a sequence as a USTX file with OpenUTAU by selecting File → Save As . Additionally, you can save a sequence as a UST file by selecting File → Export Project → Export Ust Files .",
      "NOTE: USTX files are saved in the YAML format, and can be processed as valid .YAML files."
