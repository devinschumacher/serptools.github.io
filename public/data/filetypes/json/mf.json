      "MF files are created by the \"multify\" console program included with Panda3D, which can be used to store and extract files from an MF archive. The console program can also be used to encrypt the game resource files stored in the MF archive with a password.",
      "Games that use the MF archive include: Disney's \"Pirates of the Caribbean Online\" and Autumn Moon Entertainment/Crimson Cow's \"A Vampyre Story.\" Panda3D is developed by Carnegie Mellon University."
