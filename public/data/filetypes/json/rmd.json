      "Because RMD files can contain both markdown-formatted text and chunks of R code, statisticians and data scientists use them to create dynamic presentations, reports, and other documents. This allows these users to write their reports, embed R-based data summaries within them, and export the reports to a more usable format, using just one file.",
      "Using RStudio, you can convert R Markdown files to a number of other formats, including .HTML , .PDF , .DOCX , and .PPTX . When R Studio converts an RMD file to another format, it executes the code contained within the file, creating the graphs or other data summaries that appear in the converted file."
