      "Prior to 2012, developers had to manually install NuGet as an extension to Microsoft Visual Studio. But over time, NuGet and the NUPKG format proved so essential that Microsoft began installing NuGet Package Manager with Visual Studio by default. These days, developers share thousands of NUPKG files using NuGet.org and NuGet Package Manager. Popular NuGet packages include Microsoft Entity Framework, jQuery, and JSON libraries."
