      "GIMP image hose files are used for brushing images on a canvas. Each image in the sequence is painted at the brush's spacing interval as the user draws on the canvas. Some built-in GIH files are located in the /​share/​gimp/​2.0/​brushes/​ directory of a GIMP installation.",
      "NOTE: GIH files should not be confused with GIMP non-pipe brushes ( .GBR files), which do not store multiple image layers in the brush."
