      "Indigo Renderer and Indigo RT are multiplatform 3D rendering applications primarily used by professional artists to create photorealistic images, such as building mockups or fantastical scenes for a science fiction film. Indigo Renderer offers more features than Indigo RT and is more expensive, as well. Indigo Renderer is also available as a standalone application or as a plugin for other 3D CAD programs.",
      "You can create an IGQ file with Indigo Renderer to save a queue to share with another Indigo Renderer user or save it for later use. The IGQ file also allows you to render scenes from projects created in other applications, such as 3DS Max or iClone, where the Indigo Renderer plugin is installed. You can export the project frame by frame into the IGQ file, and Indigo will individually render each frame. Then, you can combine the rendered images into an animation.",
      "You can view the render queue for your scenes by selecting \"Render Queue\" from the dropdown menu in the \"Render Settings\" pane. In the Render Queue, you can add and remove scenes and adjust other settings, such as the scene and output paths and halt settings.",
      "To create an IGQ file with Indigo Renderer or Indigo RT, select File â†’ Save Queue .",
      "The scene path in an IGQ file points to the .IGS file location from which the scenes are being rendered, whereas the output path points to the location where the files (most likely .PNG ) will be created. The output path can be relative to the scene path or absolute."
