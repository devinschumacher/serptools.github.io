      "People Playground is a violent sandbox game in which players can mutilate, crush, destroy, and otherwise harm blood-filled ragdolls. To accomplish this, players create weapons, vehicles, structures, and other items, referred to as contraptions.",
      "Each contraption is saved as a directory within People Playground's Contraptions directory. A contraption's directory consists of the following files:",
      "Often, players share contraptions with each other online, on various People Playground-related websites. These shared contraptions are often saved in .ZIP archives. Each of these ZIP archives contains the files listed above, and must be decompressed before it can be used with People Playground.",
      "NOTE: JAAP was People Playground's development codename."
