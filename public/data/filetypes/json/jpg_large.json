      "When you open a Twitter-hosted image in a new Chrome tab, the URL may look something like this:",
      "https:/​/​pbs.twimg.com/​media/​FIQbAtSX0AQ4Z7v.jpg:large",
      "If you download the image from the URL above, Chrome may save it with a JPG_LARGE file extension.",
      "Despite using a different extension, JPG_LARGE files are normal JPEG files. Twitter appends the large attribute to the image URL, causing it to end with .jpg:large . When downloading the image, Chrome changes the colon to an underscore since filenames cannot contain colons. The result is a .jpg_large file.",
      "Twitter may also create other image sizes with the corresponding extensions:",
      "NOTE: Twitter now uses the following URL structure to prevent the creation of JPG_LARGE files: https:/​/​pbs.twimg.com/​media/​FIQbAtSX0AQ4Z7v?format=jpg&name=large"
