      "Lotus 1-2-3 was first developed by Lotus Development Corporation, which was bought by IBM in 1995 and integrated into part of IBM Lotus SmartSuite. The \"1-2-3\" refers to the program's three main capabilities: 1) spreadsheet functions, 2) creating charts and graphs, and 3) basic database operations.",
      "The 123 file format is a proprietary format introduced with the release of the 97 Edition of Lotus 1-2-3 in 1997. The format replaced the .WK4 format introduced with version 4 of Lotus 1-2-3."
