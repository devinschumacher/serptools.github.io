      "In8 is a software company that specializes in publishing applications used by criminal investigators. Investigators use In8 Cite to import documents and other evidence and write investigative reports that cite that evidence. Cite report projects are saved as CIT files.",
      "After an investigator finishes writing a report, they can export the report and its supporting documentation as a .PDF file. The PDF version of the report will retain the citation links added to the CIT version. The investigator can then share this PDF file with others, so they can review the report."
