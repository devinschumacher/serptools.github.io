      "Musicians use AnthemScore to automatically transcribe music saved in .MP3 , .WAV , and other types of audio files into sheet music. After you import a song into AnthemScore, the program produces a sheet music version of the song. You can adjust this automatic transcription in AnthemScore by adding or editing notes and changing the song's meter or beats per minute.",
      "If you want to continue editing a transcription project in the future, you can save it as an ASDT file. Each ASDT file contains a reference to the song used to create it, as well as a record of the project's current state. While you can create ASDT files in the trial and paid versions of AnthemScore, you can open them only in paid versions of AnthemScore."
