      "Macros are a series of inputs and commands a user has grouped together so they can easily execute a repetitive or complex task, such as formatting a document, entering data, or performing calculations. In Microsoft Word, users can record a macro by selecting View → Macros → Record Macro . After assigning the macro to a Quick Access button or keyboard shortcut, users can click the button or press the shortcut keys to execute that macro.",
      "If a user who has utilized macros to create a Word document wants to retain those macros when they re-open or share the document, they must save the document as a DOCM file. DOCM files are saved using the same Open XML-based format used by DOCX files, but DOCM files can store macros used to create a document, while DOCX files cannot. When you open an unfamiliar DOCM file in Microsoft Word, the program will typically ask whether you want to enable macros."
