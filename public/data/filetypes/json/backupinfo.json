      "Minecraft is a 3D sandbox construction game that allows players to build nearly anything they can imagine. The original, Java edition of Minecraft allows players to use mods to enhance the game's gameplay and perform additional in-game actions.",
      "AromaBackup is a Minecraft mod that allows players to back up Minecraft worlds. That way, if a world is unintentionally corrupted, modified, or destroyed, the player can use their backup (saved within a .ZIP file) to reload the world and revert it to a previous state.",
      "Whenever AromaBackup creates a backup file, it also creates a BACKUPINFO file. The BACKUPINFO file contains information identifying the world that has been backed up, as well as the date and time at which the backup was created."
