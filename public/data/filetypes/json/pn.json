      "You will most likely only encounter a PN file if you are a program developer working with the Pinecone programming language, which is rather obscure. If you need to open a PN file to view or edit its contents, you can use a text editor since the language is stored as plain text.",
      "The Pinecone programming language was developed in 2016 by William Wold. The programming language features a simple, consistent syntax and requires a C++11 compiler to be built.",
      "Some other implemented features include:",
      "NOTE: Pinecone is no longer developed or maintained."
