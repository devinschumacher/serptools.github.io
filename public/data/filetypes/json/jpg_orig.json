      "Twitter is a social media service where users can post tweets that contain text, images, and videos. For images hosted on Twitter, the social site may automatically resize the images with a JSON entity size specification to best display an image to a user.",
      "For example, when a Google Chrome user opens the original version of an image on Twitter in a new tab, the service appends the orig specification to the image's URL, creating a URL that ends in .jpg:orig . The URL may look something like this:",
      "https:/​/​pbs.twimg.com/​media/​FHZmGkyXsAATwn6.jpg:orig",
      "If the user downloads the image from this page, Chrome saves the file with the .jpg_orig extension, producing a JPG_ORIG file.",
      "Other images hosted on Twitter's media server resized to thumbnail, small, medium, and large are saved as .JPG_THUMB , .JPG_SMALL , .JPG_MEDIUM , and .JPG_LARGE files.",
      "NOTE: Twitter changed how it specifies image sizes to prevent the creation of JPG_ORIG files. The current URL structure appears like this: https:/​/​pbs.twimg.com/​media/​FIYB3HRVQAMjdff?format=jpg&name=orig"
