      "Linux (and other Unix-like systems) users often package multiple related files together into a single TAR archive, for backup and distribution purposes. To make these archives easier to distribute, users sometimes compress them using various compression utilities.",
      "Bzip2 is a common, free compression utility. TAR files compressed using bzip2 are often renamed to use the .tbz2 extension. This denotes that the files are bzip2-compressed (like other .BZ2 files) and contain a TAR archive."
