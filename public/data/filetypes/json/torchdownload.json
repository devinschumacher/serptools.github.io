      "You will encounter a TORCHDOWNLOAD file only if you use Torch to browse the Internet and download files. When you start downloading a file, Torch creates a placeholder TORCHDOWNLOAD file in your computer's Downloads folder. This file is named in one of the following ways:",
      "When your download finishes, Torch will replace its TORCHDOWNLOAD file with your actual downloaded file. You will see a TORCHDOWNLOAD file in your Downloads folder only when a file is currently downloading or when a download was interrupted before completion (e.g. you closed your web browser, paused the download, or your Internet went out)."
