      "Like other audio files created for use on the PSP, TOC files are saved using Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding (ATRAC) compression. In this way, they are similar to .AA3 and .ATRAC files.",
      "To create TOC files, gamers use EAC or a related program, named Rockstar Custom Tracks, to convert .MP3 files to TOC files. They then save their TOC files to a custom tracks sub-directory found within a game's SAVEDATA directory. (To do this, a gamer must connect their PSP's removable storage to their computer.)"
