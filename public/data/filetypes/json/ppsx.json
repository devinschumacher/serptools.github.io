      "PPSX files are useful for sending finished presentations to users that just need to view the presentation instead of editing it. However, they can still be edited in PowerPoint but must be opened directly in the program by selecting File â†’ Open and choosing the PPSX file.",
      "PPSX files are saved in the Open XML format, which was introduced in Microsoft Office 2007. They replaced .PPS files which were used by previous versions of PowerPoint, although PowerPoint still supports PPS files."
