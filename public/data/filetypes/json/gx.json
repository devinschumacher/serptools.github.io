      "G-Code is a standard printing language that many 3D printers recognize and can use to print 3D models. However, GX files differ from typical .GCODE files in the following ways:",
      "For this reason, non-FlashForge printers may not be able to print the model a GX file describes.",
      "NOTE: GX files are similar to .G files. Both GX and G files are primarily created by FlashForge FlashPrint, the company's proprietary slicer program."
