      "Minecraft is an open-ended 3D world-building and exploration game. The game's Java Edition is popular among modders, which are players who enjoy customizing games by editing existing game files and adding new ones.",
      "Some of the files Minecraft modders examine and edit are NBT files. These are GZip-compressed files that may contain a variety of game data items. Software APIs such as JNBT (The Java NBT Library) can read the NBT format, allowing modders to decompress, open, and edit NBT files.",
      "NOTE: Many other Minecraft game data files also use the Named Binary Tag file format. For example, Minecraft's .DAT , .MCLEVEL , .MINE , and .MCR files use the Named Binary Tag file format."
