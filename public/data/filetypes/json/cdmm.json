      "ConceptDraw MINDMAP is a mind-mapping tool for helping amateurs and professionals organize and visualize ideas and plans. Before being replaced, the CDMM file type was the default format for saving mind maps in previous versions of ConceptDraw MINDMAP. Now, ConceptDraw MINDMAP saves mind maps as CDMZ files by default, but still supports the CDMM format."
