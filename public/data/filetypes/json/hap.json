      "HarmonyOS is an operating system used by Huawei smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and smart TVs. Using the Huawei AppGallery, HarmonyOS users can install compatible Android apps, packaged as .APK files, or HarmonyOS-specific apps, packaged as APP files. HarmonyOS-specific apps (many of which are marked with the designation HMOS in Huawei's AppGallery) always contain one or more HAP files.",
      "Each HarmonyOS app must contain a HAP file named Entry.hap , which is the application's main module. Apps that contain different builds optimized for different device specifications will contain more than one Entry.hap file.",
      "Most HarmonyOS apps contain additional HAP files, each of which is used to implement a specific app feature. All HAP files may contain library, resource, and configuration files, which the HAP files are dependent upon.",
      "NOTE: Developers who are creating and testing HarmonyOS apps may use Huawei DevEco Studio to create standalone HAP files, which are not packaged within an APP file."
