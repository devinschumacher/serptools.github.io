      "Graphic designers primarily use Linearity Vectornator to design icons, logos, GUI mockups, print designs, digital typography, and other vector illustrations. When a user saves a drawing in Vectornator, the application creates a VECTORNATOR file to store the illustration.",
      "NOTE: Vectornator is now known as Curve, which saves users' drawings as .CURVE files. While VECTORNATOR files and CURVE files use different file extensions, they use the same file format."
