      "Miis are avatars and NPCs used in some Nintendo video games. They are saved in many different file formats, which are specific to the console upon which the Mii is intended to be used.",
      "Wii U Miis are saved as FFSD files. The FFSD format is similar to the .CFSD Mii format that the Nintendo 3DS uses, except FFSD files' fourth byte is always set to 40. This specifies that the Mii an FFSD file contains is intended for use on the Wii U.",
      "NOTE: The website MiiLibrary.com hosts a database of official FFSD files."
