      "The PVOC file type was originally saved by ProVoc, an application developed by Arizona Software that preceded iVocabulary. However, ProVoc was eventually discontinued and now iVocabulary is the only program that creates PVOC files.",
      "While iVocabulary primarily saves vocabulary databases as IVOC files, you can export a database of vocabulary terms in ProVoc format by selecting File → Export → Export for ProVoc... .",
      "iVocabulary is utilized for various purposes, such as students studying for an exam or professionals learning new terms for their jobs. And iVocabulary users primarily save PVOC files for backing up vocabulary terms and for sharing terms with other iVocabulary users."
