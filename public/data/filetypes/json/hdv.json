      "HDV video can be recorded or printed back to tape. For domestic and consumer use, HDV video can be delivered on a Blu-ray Disc without requiring any re-encoding, or can be converted to AVCHD and delivered on an AVCHD disc, or can be downconverted to DVD-Video without being too lossy.",
      "Originally developed by JVC and subsequently supported by Sony, Canon and Sharp, the HDV format was created so as to serve as an affordable high definition format for digital camcorders.",
      "The HDV format caught on rapidly with many amateur and professional videographers owing to its low cost, portability, and an acceptable image quality for many professional productions."
