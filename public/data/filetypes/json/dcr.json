      "DCR files are similar to Flash ( .SWF ) files, but created with Adobe Director rather than Adobe Flash. Adobe Shockwaver Player can also open the file but runs as a web browser plug-in.",
      "NOTE: Director was originally developed by Macromedia, which was acquired by Adobe at the end of 2005."
