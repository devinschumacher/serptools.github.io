      "WebEx users can use the WebEx Recorder to record the actions they perform on their PC and an audio walkthrough of those actions, creating a training video or demonstration to be shared with other WebEx users. These recordings are saved as WRF files.",
      "WRF files use a proprietary video format that is recognized only by WebEx Recorder, Player, and Recording Editor. To watch the video a WRF file contains outside WebEx's players, you must convert the file to a more common video file format, such as .WMV .",
      "You can use the Cisco WebEx WRF2WMV Converter to convert a WRF file to a WMV file. WMV files can be played in many media players, including Microsoft Windows Media Player and VideoLAN VLC media player ."
