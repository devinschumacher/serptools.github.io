      "IF programs feature a narrative that can be played by typing text commands. You can also interact with objects described in the narrative to alter the environment and affect the narrative. Inform is a free application that enables you to create and share custom IF stories that other users can experience.",
      "Various file extensions have been utilized by Inform for differing versions of source code. For example, .INF files were commonly used before the release of Inform 7, and .NI files and .I7 files were introduced with Inform 7. I6 files are also used by Inform 7, primarily when files contain I6 source code with I7 code also mixed in.",
      "You can define your playable IF program in an I6 source code file. Then, you can compile it with Inform 7 into a playable file, such as a .GBLORB or .ZBLORB file.",
      "You can create an I6 file with any text editor. When you save the file, save it with the .i6 file extension. You may need to instead save the file as a .TXT file, then manually change the .txt file extension to .i6 ."
