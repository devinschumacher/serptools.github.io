      "Savage Procreate is a digital painting application designed for use on the iPad Pro. It allows artists to draw and paint images using an Apple Pencil. Procreate Pocket is a streamlined version of Procreate available for iPhones.",
      "Both versions of Procreate save artists' illustrations as PROCREATE files. These files include a record of all the layers an artist has added to their illustration, allowing the artist to continue editing any of those layers in the future. Each PROCREATE file also includes an artwork's Canvas Information and other settings data.",
      "NOTE: PROCREATE files created by Procreate 5.3 and above cannot be opened in earlier versions of Procreate. To open these files, update to the latest version of Procreate."
