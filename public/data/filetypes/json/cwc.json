      "Coding with Chrome is a Google Chrome application that allows aspiring developers to learn the basics of coding. Novice developers can use Coding with Chrome's block-based development environment, Blockly, to create basic programs, while those who have graduated to a text-based development environment can write programs directly in JavaScript, Python, and CoffeeScript.",
      "When a Coding with Chrome user creates a JavaScript-based program, Coding with Chrome saves the user's program in a CWC file. All programs that developers create in Blockly are saved in CWC files, as are all JavaScript-based programs that developers create in Coding with Chrome's text-based development environment."
