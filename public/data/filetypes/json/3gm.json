      "In the late 1990s and the 2000s, The Groove Alliance developed many games using the 3D Groove game development engine. They also licensed the engine to other developers. Most of these games were licensed games that advertised a product or starred TV cartoon characters. For example, the games Mountain Dew Skateboarding, Pringles Pony Express, and Jack Daniel's Real Pool were developed using the 3D Groove Engine, as were many games for NickArcade and Disney.com.",
      "Many 3D Groove Engine games use 3D models saved in the 3DGM Model file format. Typically, these files use the .3gm extension. 3GM files are similar to .3DS files, except they include additional features.",
      "NOTE: 3GM files sometimes instead use the .3dg extension."
