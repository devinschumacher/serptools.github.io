      "Microsoft released the first version of Windows's now-ubiquitous Snipping Tool in 2002. This version was available for only Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, as part of the Experience Pack add-on. It allowed tablet users to take screenshots of some or all of their tablet's screen and then add highlights, annotations, or other marks.",
      "The Windows XP Tablet PC Edition version of Snipping Tool saved users' screenshots as SNIP files by default. When Microsoft added the Snipping Tool to other versions of Windows, they updated the tool to save screenshots in more common image formats, such as .JPG and .PNG ."
