      "The Godot Engine, more commonly referred to as just Godot, is an open-source game engine that developers can use to create 2D and 3D video games. The Godot Integrated Development Environment ( IDE ) includes a number of tools developers use to develop, package, and deploy games, including the Godot script editor.",
      "The Godot script editor is an integrated text editor developers use to create and edit scripts included in their games. If a developer wants to change the way the script editor highlights scripts' syntax (i.e. the colors the script editor uses to highlight declarations, commands, and functions), they can do so by applying a different theme to the script editor. Godot script editor themes are saved in TET files, which are stored in the following locations on users' PCs:",
      "Godot's default installation includes a number of TET files, which can be used to apply different syntax themes to the Godot script editor. To change your Godot script editor theme, select Editor → Editor Settings → Text Editor from Godot's menu bar. Then, select the theme you want to apply to the script editor."
