      "You can create the SCI file with the Scilab editor. When you execute the commands in the SCI file the functions are loaded into the Scilab environment but the program does not execute them. The SCI file is similar to the .SCE file as they are both used by Scilab to contain multiple commands. However, the SCE file can contain executable statements as well, not just Scilab functions."
