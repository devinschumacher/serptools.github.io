      "OpenPixel is an image creation tool that allows users to produce tile-based images, by using keys on their keyboard to specify each tile's color. It was developed by kevidryon2 (Kevin Rossi) and uses the raylib development library.",
      "After creating an image in OpenPixel, users can save that image as a KOPS file. This file stores not only the image itself, but the last macro a user recorded before saving the image."
