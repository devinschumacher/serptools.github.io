      "CDML files are created using the \"Export\" feature in the toolbar of the program. By exporting your diagram to a CDML file and saving it on your computer you are able to store a local backup of your work. You can also export diagrams to .PDF , .JPG , and .PNG files. To import a CDML file, simply select \"Import\" from the toolbar.",
      "Creately also enables you to share your diagram with others. You can send a link to other collaborators with editing or viewing permissions and publish it to a web page, Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn."
