      "The most common Minecraft properties file is server.properties , which stores configuration data for a multiplayer server. It saves information such as the level name, monster spawning settings, the maximum allowed players, and the server port and IP address.",
      "You will likely only encounter a PROPERTIES file in the context of Minecraft if you are looking to modify the configuration of a multiplayer server. Specifically, you can find the server.properties file in the same directory as the server.jar file you executed to run the server (the server generates it upon its first startup)."
