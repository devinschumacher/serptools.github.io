      "On smartphones that use Symbian OS, such as some older Sony Ericsson and Nokia smartphones, users could purchase media from various online stores (e.g., the Ovi Store). Some of this media was saved in the DCF format.",
      "To create DCF files, content creators used DRM applications such as Sony Ericsson DRM Packager. Content creators could then upload their copy-protected media files to the appropriate online store, for purchase by users."
