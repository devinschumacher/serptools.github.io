      "BlindWrite can read, write, and back up CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs. Recent versions of the BlindWrite no longer create B02 files but you may still encounter the files if you have split data from an unprotected CD into multiple segments with an older version of BlindWrite.",
      "B02 files are typically accompanied by a .B00 file and .B01 file in the same folder. These B00 and B01 files also store data segments from the same disc that make up the whole data.",
      "The reason older versions of BlindWrite created segments of data was to reduce the size of the backup files into smaller, more manageable file sizes. Each segment of the CD data was given an ascending number extension by BlindWrite, which starts with B00, then B01, followed by B02, and so on. However, as storage space has increased over the years, the use of these segmented files declined and the files were eventually removed."
