      "Trunked radio systems are systems that contain one or more control channels and a number of other, associated frequencies. In these systems, while a user's two-way radio is tuned to the control channel, their radio automatically broadcasts using one of the associated, trunked frequencies.",
      "Radio scanning enthusiasts use trunk tracking scanners, like the PRO-96 and PRO-2096, to scan and log activity on trunked systems. These enthusiasts can then use associated software, such as Win96, to log, analyze, edit, and export the data they've collected using their trunk tracking scanner. This data is typically saved in proprietary database formats, such as the P96 format."
