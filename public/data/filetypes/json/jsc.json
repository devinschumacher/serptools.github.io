      "Node.js is an open-source JavaScript runtime environment , used to run JavaScript programs on a server. Bytecode is a Node.js package, which developers can add to Node.js and use to compile their program's JS files to JSC files.",
      "Primarily, compiling a JS file to a JSC file is meant to prevent app users and other developers from examining, and potentially stealing or altering, the app's source code. For example, a developer creating a browser-based video game using Node.js may choose to compile the game's JS files to JSC files, to prevent other developers from copying their game's logic.",
      "NOTE: Bytenode also works with Electron, a JavaScript desktop application framework that uses Node.js."
