      "PMF files can limit the data views, layouts, navigation, printing, querying, panning, and zooming capabilities of the map. They may also be password protected. This helps to protect the confidentiality and privacy of data.",
      "Published maps do not contain actual geographical data. Instead, they link to data sets at a central remote location, which may be hosted by an ArcMap Server or available over the Internet. Therefore, users need appropriate network access to the referenced data repository to view the maps.",
      "NOTE: PMF files are actually created by ArcGIS Publisher, an extension included with ArcMap."
