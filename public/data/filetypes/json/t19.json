      "When you begin a tax return in Tax Software 2019, you can import data from the previous year by importing a .T18 file. You can also import tax information from your H&R Block account or another tax service, such as TurboTax or TaxAct.",
      "If you have no information to import, you will be asked to enter your basic information and social security number. The software guides you as you add other tax information, including any 2019 life changes, income, deductions, adjustments, and credits on the federal and state levels.",
      "When you choose to save your tax return, H&R Block Tax Software creates the T19 file to store your progress. You can save your tax return as a T19 file, close it, then re-open it at a later time to continue working.",
      "H&R Block Tax Software saves T19 files in the \"HR Block\" folder in your \"Documents\" folder by default. Once you finish your tax return, you can electronically file it directly with H&R Block Tax Software or print and mail it to the appropriate tax authorities.",
      "You may also use the T19 file as a backup tax return for archival purposes. To create a backup in Tax Software select File â†’ Backup Tax Return... .",
      "NOTE: The file extension appended onto H&R Block tax returns indicates the year of the return. T18 files store information for 2018 tax returns, .T17 files store information for 2017 tax returns, and so on."
