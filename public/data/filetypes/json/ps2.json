      "When players save an in-progress game on a PlayStation 2, the system saves the game data to a removable memory card. Typically, PS2 memory cards can store up to 8 MB of saved game data. (This is enough space for roughly 15 saved games.)",
      "PCSX2 and AetherSX2 use PS2 files to replicate the functionality of PS2 memory cards. Players can use menu options to create new PS2 files and load existing PS2 files. After loading a PS2 file into a memory card slot and starting their emulator, players can access the PS2 file's data just as they would a standard PS2 memory card's data (from the PS2's Browser screen).",
      "NOTE: Sharkport, a PS2 data transfer accessory, stores players' saved games as files that use the .ps2 extension. These files are not the same as PCSX2 PS2 files. Thus, if your PS2 file does not work with PCSX2 or AetherSX2, it may be a Sharkport PS2 file."
