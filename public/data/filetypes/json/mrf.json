      "The MRF file is the primary file type associated with Mouse Recorder. After recording your mouse activity in the program, an MRF file is created to store the information. You can open the MRF file to replay actions and edit the macro in case you want to change any activity.",
      "To create an MRF file, select File → New then select File → Save . To open an MRF file, select File → Open and navigate to the location of the MRF file.",
      "When saving an MRF file you can choose the name or you can leave it as the default name to help organize your MRF files by the time they were created. Default names typically begin as \"Macro\" then followed by the date and time. An example filename is Macro_2_21_2018 10-20-23 AM.mrf ."
