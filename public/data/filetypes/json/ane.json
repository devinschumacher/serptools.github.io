      "AIR Native Extensions wrap native system code in Adobe's ActionScript language. For example, to invoke volume or vibrate functions on an Android device, the ANE file would contain native Android source code written in Java that can be run through an ActionScript function call.",
      "ANE files are also used for bundling third-party libraries and frameworks in AIR applications."
