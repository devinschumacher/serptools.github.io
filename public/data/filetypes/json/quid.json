      "Scratchware released QuidProQuo in 2020 as a rich text editor. The program allows you to create various types of text documents, such as reports, letters, essays, and resumes.",
      "However, Scratchware replaced QuidProQuo in March 2024. It offers many of the same functionality, including altering the font and size of text, but saves documents as QPQD files by default."
