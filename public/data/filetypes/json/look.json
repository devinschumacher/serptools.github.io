      "Adobe developed SpeedGrade to enable filmmakers, editors, and visual effects artists to color grade their productions more accurately. The software integrates with other video editing applications, such as Premiere Pro and After Effects .",
      "You can adjust the coloring of videos to give them a look and feel, such as adding blues for sadness, reds for intensity, and oranges for warmth. Then, when you want to save the color grading settings you have applied, you can save them as LOOK files.",
      "To save a look as a LOOK file, grade the color of a video, click the \"Save Look\" icon in the Look tab on the lower-right corner of the Layers panel. The look should then appear in the Look browser and is saved in the following directory based on the computer platform:",
      "NOTE: Adobe discontinued SpeedGrade in August 2017."
