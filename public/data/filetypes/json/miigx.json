      "Miis are customizable avatars that players use to represent themselves on various Nintendo game consoles, such as the Nintendo Wii. While most players are content to design Miis using the options available on their game console, some players enjoy modding their Miis using player-created, PC-based mod programs, such as My Avatar Editor.",
      "Players who want to extract a Mii from their Wii, so they can mod that Mii on their computer, can do so using savegame-manager-gx. Savegame-manager-gx saves extracted Miis as MIIGX files. Savegame-manager-gx also allows players to import custom Miis to their Wii. Custom Miis must be saved as MIIGX files to be used with savegame-manager-gx.",
      "NOTE: If you encounter a Mii saved in the .MAE format used by My Avatar Editor and want to use it with savegame-manager-gx, you can simply rename the file to use the .miigx extension. Then, you can import the Mii using savegame-manager-gx."
