      "When you generate a report with Visual FoxPro, the application creates an FRX file to store the main content and formatting. It also creates a corresponding .FRT report memo file to accompany the FRX file, which stores metadata about the report. When previewing or printing reports, the application references both files to render the report correctly.",
