      "ADF files are saved with an .ALF lookup file, which contains metadata required to navigate, backup, and restore the ACT! database. ADF files may also be archived within ACT! database backups, which use the .BAK extension. ADF files use Microsoft SQL Server formatting and are similar to .MDF files.",
