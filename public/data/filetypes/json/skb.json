      "SKB files are created by only the Windows version of SketchUp and appear as [filename].skb . The macOS version autosaves models with the .skp extension as [filename]~.skp .",
      "SKB files are typically saved in the \"My Documents\" folder with the original SKP file. However, the location can be changed by selecting Preferences → Files → Models... . SKB files contain the version of the model that was saved before the current version of the model in the SKP file.",
      "If you are having trouble opening an SKB file, you may need to change the extension from .skb to .skp in order to open it.",
      "SketchUp is primarily used to create 3D models related to architecture, interior design, film, video game design, and mechanical engineering. It is free to download."
