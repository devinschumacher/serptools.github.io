      "Apple released the Apple II computer in 1977. As Apple's first entry into the home computing market, the Apple II represented a huge shift in the company's priorities and focus, culminating in the many consumer market products that Apple produces today. Largely, the Apple II was hailed as a success, resulting in a number of follow-up releases before Apple discontinued the Apple II line in 1993.",
      "The Apple II allowed users to load and run programs in a variety of ways, including via cassette tape. To run cassette-based software, users had to purchase a cassette deck, connect it to their Apple II, and play their cassette in the deck. Then, they had to follow a series of instructions included with the cassette.",
      "Apple II enthusiasts have cataloged and converted a number of cassette-based programs for use with Apple II emulators, so they can relive the PC's glory days. In Virtual ][, the files that contain these converted programs use the CASS extension."
