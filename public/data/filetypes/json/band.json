      "Apple GarageBand is the default DAW included with macOS; it is also available for iOS devices. GarageBand allows users to import, create, edit, and mix audio tracks to create and publish songs.",
      "When a GarageBand user saves an audio editing project, that project is saved as a BAND file. BAND files are macOS packages, whose contents can be viewed by right-clicking them and selecting Show Package Contents . Each BAND file stores a copy of the audio files that have been imported into that project, as well as an XML projectData file used to load the project's timeline and settings. BAND files may also include other folders, which store additional project resources."
