      "Panasonic DTPS allows those working with certain Panasonic welding robots, such as the TM-1400, to design programs those robots can execute. For example, a user can design a program that specifies and automates how a robot welds a standard set of parts together into a single component.",
      "After creating a program, users save that program as an RPG file. They then transfer this compiled, binary file to a robot's controller device (such as the G3 Robot Controller), from which they can execute the program the RPG file contains."
