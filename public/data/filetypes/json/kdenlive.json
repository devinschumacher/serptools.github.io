      "Kdenlive is a free video editing program that allows users to import video, audio, and other media and combine those files into a single movie. Users can export their movies as .MP4 , .WEBM , .MPEG2 , and other types of video files.",
      "The program saves users' in-progress video editing projects as KDENLIVE files. These files are text files; they do not actually include any video, audio, or media files. They contain only references to those files' locations. As such, if you move a media file from the location referenced in your KDENLIVE file, your project will not load correctly in Kdenlive (as the program will not be able to find the moved media file)."
