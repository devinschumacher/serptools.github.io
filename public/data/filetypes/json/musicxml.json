    "description": [
      "The W3C Music Notation Community developed the open MusicXML standard for musicians and composers to more easily share sheet music between applications and archive sheet music for future use or preservation. The format is so common that most music notation applications support it.",
      "NOTE: Since MusicXML files can be large, MuseScore allows you to save them as compressed .MXL files to reduce their size. MXL files help save space when backing up files or sharing scores between notation programs."
