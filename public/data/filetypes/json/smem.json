      "Samsung Smart Switch is the official backup app used to transfer a user's messages, contacts, notes, call history, settings, and other data from one Samsung Galaxy to another. Each backup Smart Switch creates is comprised of several encrypted files, each of which contains a portion of the user's data. SMEM files contain a user's Samsung Messages history.",
      "Because SMEM files are encrypted, you cannot simply open them to read or retrieve your text messages. Instead, you must transfer the file to a Samsung Galaxy phone using Samsung Smart Switch."
