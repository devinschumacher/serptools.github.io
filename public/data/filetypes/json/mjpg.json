      "MJPG videos are saved in the Motion JPEG (aka MJPEG or M-JPEG) format. Most notably, each frame of an MJPG video is compressed separately, using intraframe compression . This allows MJPG videos to retain a higher image quality than .MPEG and .MP4 videos, which use interframe compression. For this reason, the MJPG format is often used by videographers, to save videos they plan to edit using video editing programs.",
      "However, because intraframe compression does not reduce a video's file size as much as interframe compression does, MJPG videos are usually larger than comparable MPEG and MP4 videos. This makes the MPEG and MP4 formats better for storing a large number of videos on a device or drive."
