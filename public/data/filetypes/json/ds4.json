      "Micrografx Designer was a vector-based graphics program available for Windows. After competitor Corel purchased Microgafx, they rebranded the program to Corel DESIGNER. Corel DESIGNER is now part of the CorelDRAW Technical Suite.",
      "Engineers and graphic designers used Micrografx Designer to create technical drawings and business-related graphics. In versions 4 and 4.1, Designer saved these images as DS4 files. Before version 4, Designer saved images as .DRW files. In versions 6 to 9, Designer saved images as .DSF files.",
      "NOTE: Current versions of Corel DESIGNER save images as .DES files."
