      "Camtasia is a Windows and macOS tool that captures screen activity, such as a software demonstration, how-to tutorial, video conference, or online gaming session. The software comes packaged with various resources for enhancing videos, such as templates, motion graphics, lower thirds, and themes. You can also create custom resources with Camtasia.",
      "TechSmith developed the CAMPACKAGE file type to allow you to transfer resources referenced by a project when sharing the project or backing it up. Then, you or another Camtasia user can import the resources into a .TSCPROJ or .CMPROJ project.",
      "To create a CAMPACKAGE file with Camtasia, open a project, then select File → Export → Package . After exporting the package, you can share it with other Camtasia users or store it in a safe location as a backup."
