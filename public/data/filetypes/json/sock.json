      "Sockets are software components that allow programs to communicate with each other and servers. In Unix, users can create file-based socket endpoints saved as SOCK files. For example, those using uWSGI to host and communicate with a web server can create a SOCK file for that web server. Other programs that need to access the web server can then refer to the SOCK file.",
      "Each SOCK file contains all the information needed to communicate with the program or server with which it is meant to be used. For example, it contains information about the protocol used for communication and the type of data that can be sent using the socket."
