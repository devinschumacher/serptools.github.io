      "Much like Windows .DLL files, SO files are saved in a specific place in a user's file system and \"dynamically linked\" to programs at runtime, meaning they are loaded only when needed. When a program needs to perform a common function stored in an SO file, it calls that SO file, relying on the fact that the SO file has a specific name and is stored in a specific location. If the function is linked to other SO files, the program also calls the linked SO files.",
      "SO files often reside in the following Linux directories:",
      "C and C++ programs installed on the Linux and Android operating systems most commonly use SO files. Developers often build SO files using the \"gcc\" C/C++ compiler included in the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)."
