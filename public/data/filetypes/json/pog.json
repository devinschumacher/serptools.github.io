      "In the Descent series, players pilot a spaceship through several underground mines to eliminate an alien computer virus infecting those mines. Descent 2 is the middle game in the series.",
      "The original Descent stored textures, sounds, and model data in PIG files. Descent 2 also contains PIG files, but uses POG files to replace some of the textures stored in its PIG files with updated versions."
