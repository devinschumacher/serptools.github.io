      "FMOD Studio is a sound design tool that video game developers use to create adaptive sound effects and music. They can then integrate these audio files with a video game, using event-based metadata specified in FMOD Studio and exported alongside the audio files.",
      "Each FMOD Studio project (comprised of a project directory and various project assets) contains an FSPRO file. This file is a pointer file used to open the project in FMOD Studio.",
      "After a user finishes editing their FMOD Studio project, they can export the sounds and metadata it contains as a .BANK file. They can then import the BANK file into Unity, CryEngine, Valve Source, Unreal Engine, and other game development engines, to integrate the sounds they've created with their in-development video game.",
      "NOTE: If a user has integrated FMOD Studio with Unity, their FMOD Studio project and FSPRO file may be stored within a Unity project directory."
