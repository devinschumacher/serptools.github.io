      "If you receive an error during gameplay that looks similar to, \"Vehicle extensions (.veh) too large,\" it means that there are too many vehicles for the game to load. To solve this problem, you can remove some of your vehicles in order to be within the game's limit. You can also try a mod that increases the vehicle limit or even removes the limit altogether.",
      "NOTE: Similar to the .VWP file used by Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy."
