      "AUX files are written when a .TEX file is typeset (formatted to an output document) by LaTeX. Since the generation of LaTeX documentation can take multiple passes before the document is complete (because of file and citation cross-referencing), the AUX file is used to store information between runs of the LaTeX compilation process."
