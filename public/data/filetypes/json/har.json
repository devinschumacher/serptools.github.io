      "The purpose of the HAR format is to log the performance of web browsers, which allows developers to analyze how well the browsers are loading webpages. HAR files may be exported by various HTTP-related tools, such as Electron HAR, HttpWatch, HTTP Toolkit, but are typically exported by web browsers. Most browsers support the format, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer.",
      "You can open HAR files with various programs, including the online HAR Viewer tool and the open source, cross-platform HTTP Toolkit. Since HAR files are saved in JSON format, you can also open them using a JSON editor or a plain text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad or Apple TextEdit.",
      "If you open a HAR file in a text editor, you will see the contents in the JSON format organized into the following object types:",
      "NOTE: The HAR format is developed by the Web Performance Working Group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)."
