      "Mario Kart Wii's Time Trial mode allows players to race against developer- and player-created ghosts, in order to beat those ghosts' course times and win rewards. Each ghost's data is saved in an RKG file.",
      "In addition to the data used to show a ghost during a race, RKG files contain metadata that specifies a ghost's course and lap times. In rare scenarios, Mario Kart Wii ghosts may be affected by objects that were not present during their creation, causing the ghost to desynchronize from its RKG file and veer wildly off course. This scenario is known as the Wiggler Glitch."
