      "Winamp is a free media player that supports many audio and video formats and provides tools for organizing media files. The program also allows users to customize its appearance, using files referred to as Winamp skins.",
      "By default, Winamp includes a handful of skins. However, the Winamp community has created thousands of additional custom skins, which are stored on websites such as Winamp Heritage and the Winamp Skin Museum. Typically, these skins are saved as WSZ files.",
      "WSZ files are Zip-compressed archives that contain all the component files needed to transform Winamp's appearance. Specifically, WSZ files contain 45 different files, most of which are BMP images that are applied to Winamp's buttons, borders, and other UI items. WSZ files also contain CUR files, which transform a user's cursor, and .TXT files, which specify how the skin's images should be applied.",
      "Users who want to create their own Winamp skins can do so using a variety of custom skin creation programs. SkinAmp is one popular program that allows users to create their own WSZ files.",
      "NOTE: Winamp skins may also be saved as .WAL files."
