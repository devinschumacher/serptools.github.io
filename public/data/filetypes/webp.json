The WebP format reduces file size more than standard JPEG compression while maintaining similar or better image quality.  It supports both lossy and lossless compression and includes an alpha channel for transparency, similar to the PNG format.\n\n\nMore Information\n\n\n\n\nWEBP file open in Microsoft Edge 97\n\n\nGoogle developed the WebP format with technology it acquired from On2 Technologies in 2009 to improve upon the JPEG, PNG, and GIF formats.  In 2010, Google released WebP as an open format, extending it with new features, such as animation, transparency, and additional metadata support, in subsequent years.\nWebP features a container format based on the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF), an open format developed by Microsoft and IBM.  Additionally, lossy compression utilized in WebP is loosely based on the royalty-free VP8 video format.  In contrast, a Google software engineer named Jyrki Alakuijala designed WebP's lossless compression algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to open a WEBP file\n\nYou can open a WEBP file with various image editors, such as Image Magick (multiplatform) and XnViewMP (multiplatform).  In addition, most major web browsers support WEBP files, including Google Chrome (multiplatform), Microso"

You can also upload WebP images to Google Photos to view them with the web application."
