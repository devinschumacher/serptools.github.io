It is a raster graphic similar to a .JPG image but is compressed with lossless compression and supports transparency. \n\n\nMore Information\n\n\n\n\nPNG file open in Microsoft Photos 2021\n\n\nPNG is one of the most common image formats, along with JPEG, GIF, TIFF, and EPS.  Examples of when you might encounter a PNG file include:\n\nDownloading an image from the Internet or an image attached to an email\nSaving a digital photograph with an image editor, such as a logo or icon designed by a graphics professional or web designer\nTaking a screenshot in Windows or macOS 10.4 and later (Ubuntu Linux also stores print screen screenshots in the PNG format)\n\nWhy the PNG format was created\n\nPNG was created in 1995 to be a free alternative to the GIF format for transferring images on the web.  It improved upon the limitations of the GIF format, which supported a limited number of colors and included a patent license.  Additionally, while GIF images only support fully opaque or fully transparent pixels, PNG images may include an 8-bit transparency channel, which allows the image colors to fade from opaque to transparent.\nOther PNG features include"
