Mindscape released LEGO Island in 1997.","The game includes several SI asset packages. These files contain a variety of related game assets whose data is interleaved together. This interleaving makes it easier for LEGO Island to load assets simultaneously. For example, when the game needs to load a line of dialogue and corresponding animation, it can find and read one interleaved section of data from the associated SI file, instead of having to seek, find, and load separate data chunks for each asset.","NOTE: The game Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat also uses SI files."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"JUKEBOX.SI","description":"JUKEBOX.SI - Contains LEGO Island music tracks and dialogue."},{"filename":"NOCD.SI","description":"NOCD.SI - The only SI file installed in LEGO Island's install directory.
