This file is a type of SQLite 3 database that stores metadata associated with your images and tracks all your changes, including cropping, exposure adjustments, and filters. Instead of embedding edits directly in the image files, Lightroom saves them in the MCAT file, so your original photos remain untouched. It also records where your photos are stored, so Lightroom can reference them when needed.","Lightroom also generates a separate MCAT file in its profiles directory, which contains metadata about Lightroom Profiles, presets that can be applied during photo editing to achieve specific looks or effects. Lightroom automatically manages these MCAT files."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"Managed Catalog.mcat","description":"Managed Catalog.mcat - The name assigned to your default Lightroom photo catalog file."}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mcat.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
