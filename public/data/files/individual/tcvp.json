Further investigation revealed that TCVP ransomware is a variant of the popular STOP DJVU family of ransomware.","After encrypting a user's files, TCVP ransomware produces a plain text ( .TXT ) ransom note in every folder that contains an infected file. This ransom note contains instructions users can supposedly follow to decrypt their files.","TCVP ransomware is most commonly distributed within programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed an unverified program, that may be how your computer became infected by TCVP ransomware."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tcvp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
