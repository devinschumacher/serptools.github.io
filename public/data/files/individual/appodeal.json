To do so, developers use Appodeal's software development kit ( SDK ) to add calls to Appodeal's advertising network to their apps.","Apps that show Appodeal advertisements create an APPODEAL file that is stored in Android devices' Internal Shared Storage folder. While the file's exact purpose is unknown, it always contains the text e30= .
