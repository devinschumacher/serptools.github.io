JARC archives contain in-game model, texture, and animation files. Together, these files are used to show and animate game characters, locations, and items.","JTEX files are in-game texture files, which contain an image or images that are layered atop an in-game model ( .JMDL file) to \"skin\" it. For example, the files used to add color, textures, shadows, and depth to One Piece: Super Grand Battle! X's characters are saved as JTEX files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"jtex.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
