However, Corel eventually acquired Pinnacle Studio in 2012 and replaced the STX format (along with the .SCN and .STU formats) with the AXP format.","Since AXP files replaced STX files, the files have become obscure. You will likely only encounter STX files if you are trying to open an old project."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"stx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
