The scripts are used in a wide range of software environments and are especially common in engineering and embedded system contexts, where it is helpful for writing configuration scripts and test cases.","NOTE: John Ousterhout developed the Tcl scripting language in the late 1980s while working at the University of California, Berkeley. Now, the Tcl Core Team maintains it under the guidance of the Tcl Developer Xchange, an open-source community that oversees its ongoing development."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tcl.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
