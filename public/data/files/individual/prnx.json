The files can only be opened with DevExpress Reporting Suite.","If you acquire a PRNX file and do not have access to the Reporting Suite you should ask the sender to export the report as a .PDF or .RTF file. You can open a PDF file with a large number of programs, including Adobe Acrobat, Microsoft Word, Apple Preview, and LibreOffice. If you would like to convert the data in the report to a different format or would just like to view it in text format, ask for an RTF file. You can view and edit an RTF file with various text editors, including Microsoft WordPad, Apple TextEdit, and AbiSource AbiWord."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"prnx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
