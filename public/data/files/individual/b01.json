{"slug":"b01","extension":"b01","name":"BlindWrite CD Data Segment File","category":"blindwrite-cd-data-segment-file","summary":"","developer_org":"vso-software","developer_name":"VSO Software","more_information":{"description":["BlindWrite can read, write, and back up CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs. While more recent versions of the software no longer create B01 files, you may still encounter the files if you split data from an unprotected CD into multiple segments with an older version of BlindWrite.","In this case, you will most likely find a .B00 file and possibly a .B02 file in the same folder as the B01 file. These B00 and B02 files also store data segments from the same disc that make up the whole data.","The reason older versions of BlindWrite would create segments of data is to reduce the size of the backup files into smaller, more manageable file sizes. Each segment of the CD data was given an ascending number extension by BlindWrite, which starts with B00, then B01, followed by B02, and so on. However, as storage space has increased over the years, the use of these segmented files declined and the files were eventually removed."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"b01.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
