This file is stored in the following location:","C:/​Users/​YourUserName/​AppData/​Roaming/​Microsoft/​Sticky Notes","Initially, Microsoft included the Windows 8 version of Sticky Notes in Windows 10. However, Microsoft replaced the Windows 8 version of Sticky Notes with a new version in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. The Windows 10 Anniversary Update and Windows 11 version of Sticky Notes do not create or use SNT files. (Instead, they store a user's notes in a .SQLITE database.)","NOTE: SNT files created by the Windows Vista and Windows 7/8/10 versions of Sticky Notes are not compatible. Thus, the Windows 7/8/10 version of Sticky Notes cannot load a Windows Vista SNT file, and vice versa."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"Sticky.snt","description":"Sticky.snt - The default name assigned to Windows Vista SNT files."},{"filename":"StickyNotes.snt","description":"StickyNotes.snt - The default name assigned to Windows 7/8/10 SNT files."}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"snt.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
