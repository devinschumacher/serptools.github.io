The game's players have created a vibrant modding community that provides custom sabers, blocks, levels, and other items to players.","In the Quest version of Beat Saber, players install mods primarily using BMBF, a modding application. One of the mods players can install is Qosmetics. Qosmetics allows players to import and use custom sabers, blocks, and walls.","Custom sabers created for use with Qosmetics are saved as WHACKER files. Most often, modders create WHACKER files using the Qosmetics Unity Project, a Unity project designed specifically to be used to create custom Beat Saber for Quest assets."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"whacker.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
