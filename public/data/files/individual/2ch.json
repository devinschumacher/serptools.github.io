All SACDs contain audio saved in the Direct Stream Digital (DSD) audio format, which notably supports up to six audio channels. However, many SACDs also contain a \"normal CD layer,\" which includes the same audio remixed into a two-channel format.","These two-channel audio files are saved as 2CH files. Each 2CH file is encoded using 16-bit pulse-code modulation and sampled at 44.1 kHz. Normal CD players can read and play a disc's 2CH files, allowing users to play their SACDs in SACD and CD players."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"2ch.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
