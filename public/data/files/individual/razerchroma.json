If a Razer device owner wants to control how the LEDs their product includes light up, they can do so using Chroma Studio, an RGB color profile creation tool included with Razer's Synapse hardware management program. Chroma Studio allows users to determine in what colors and patterns their LEDs light up, and it saves these settings as color profiles.","In Synapse 2, Chroma Studio saved users' color profiles as RAZERCHROMA files. However, in Synapse 3, Chroma Studio began saving users' color profiles as CHROMAEFFECTS files. These files are not interchangeable, so if you want to recreate a Synapse 2 color profile in Synapse 3, you will have to do so manually."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"razerchroma.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
