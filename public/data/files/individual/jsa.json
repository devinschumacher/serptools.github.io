These servlets are used to generate dynamic webpages, using Java functions stored in one or more JSP files.","Each JRun servlet may contain a JSA file, which is used to determine what happens when JRun begins serving an application, when a user session starts, when a user session ends, and when JRun stops serving the application. For example, the JSA file's onApplicationStart() method determines what happens when the associated application starts for the first time.","NOTE: Java servlets created using Resin Server and Oracle software may also use JSA files. Java servlets developed in other applications do not use JSA files."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"global.jsa","description":"global.jsa - The default name assigned to JSA files."}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"jsa.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
