The PKL file is created using Python pickle and the dump() method and is loaded using Python pickle and the load() method.","There are three protocols used for pickling: Version 0 - The original ASCII protocol, which is backwards compatible with earlier Python versions. Version 1 - The old binary format, which is backwards compatible with earlier Python versions. Version 2 - Python 2.3 format, which features more efficient pickling of new style classes. NOTE: PKL files may also have the .PICKLE extension but more commonly have the .P extension.","NOTE: PKL files may also have the .PICKLE extension but more commonly have the .P extension."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/pkl_13804.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .pkl file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code 1.99","caption":"PKL file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code 1.99"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pkl.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
