It is available for Windows and Linux. The game enjoys a healthy modding community, which distributes via mod management applications such as Satisfactory Mod Manager.","Players can use Satisfactory Mod Manager to install approved Satisfactory mods with just one click. Each time a player installs a mod, Satisfactory Mod Manager adds the mod to the player's Mod Manager profile. If a player wants to quickly install all their mods in another instance of Satisfactory Mod Manager (for example, because they've begun playing Satisfactory on a new computer), they can do so by exporting their Mod Manager profile as an SMMPROFILE file, and then importing the file in the other instance of Mod Manager."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"smmprofile.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
