The format is intended to be an open-source format that is easier to implement and faster to use than PNG.","Specifically, QOI images can be encoded 20 to 50 times faster than similar-sized PNG images, and they can be decoded 3 to 4 times faster. Each QOI image includes a 14-byte header, which identifies the image as a QOI file and specifies the image's width, height, included channels, and colorspace."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/qoi_12795.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .qoi file in ImageMagick","caption":"QOI file open in ImageMagick"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"qoi.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
