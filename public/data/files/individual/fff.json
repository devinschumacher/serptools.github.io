Therefore, if you want to share an image captured as an FFF file, you should convert it to a more widely supported format, such as .JPEG , .PNG , or .TIFF . Converting the FFF image to one of these formats compresses the image data, making it easier to share it online.","NOTE: Hasselblad cameras may also capture images as .3FR files."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/fff_7602.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .fff file in Adobe Photoshop 2022","caption":"FFF file open in Adobe Photoshop 2022"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"fff.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
