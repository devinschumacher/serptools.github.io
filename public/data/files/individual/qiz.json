The Exam Builder tool allows mathematics and scientific instructors to design different types of quizzes that can be taken and graded online by students.","Every time a student opens a QIZ file in Scientific Notebook or WorkPlace, the questions are rearranged, meaning every time a student opens the QIZ file to take the quiz, he will encounter different questions. This allows instructors to build tests that are more challenging and dynamic than a static test that displays the same questions and answers every time it is opened."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"qiz.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
