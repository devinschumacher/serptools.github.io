For example, a VLC media player user who is also a Star Trek fan could download and apply a Star Trek-themed skin to make VLC's interface look like a Star Trek touchpad. VLC skins are saved in VLT files.","VLT files are created and edited in VideoLAN VLC Skin Editor, a separate application designed specifically to let users create VLC media player skins. The files are ZIP archives that contain all of a skin's assets and an XML file that specifies where and how those assets should appear.","Because VLT files are Zip archives, you can decompress them with a Zip decompression utility and examine their contents if needed. For example, if you wanted to extract an image used in a VLT file, you could do so by decompressing the file.","NOTE: VLC skins work with only the Windows and Linux versions of VLC media player. They do not work with the macOS version."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/vlt_5374.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .vlt file in VLC media player","caption":"VLT file open in VLC media player"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vlt.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
