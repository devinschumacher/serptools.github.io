Developers can use SIP to call C and C++ functions from Python programs, translating them into Python code. To do so, developers must install SIP, create a SIP file that defines the C or C++ library they want to access, and use the SIP build system to include the SIP file and associated library in a Python program.","Typically, each SIP file looks very similar to a C or C++ library's header file. However, the SIP file includes a reference to the library's header file, and it may omit some of the library's functions and add additional functions. For example, if a function does not make sense to use in Python, the SIP file may not include that function."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/sip_12847.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .sip file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"SIP file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sip.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
