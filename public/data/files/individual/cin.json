Film artists used the Cineon system to scan film, saving each frame as a CIN file. They then modified the frames digitally with software included with Cineon System and output them back to film via the Cineon System recorder with no loss of image quality.","While the Cineon System is no longer in use (discontinued in the late 1990s as Kodak introduced the .DPX format), the format has persisted. Therefore, you may still encounter CIN files if you are a visual effects artist."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/cin_390.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .cin file in Adobe Photoshop 2023","caption":"CIN file open in Adobe Photoshop 2023"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/cin_12973-2.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .cin file in Piotr Fusik RECOIL","caption":"CIN file open in Piotr Fusik RECOIL"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"cin.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
