Among other things, administrators can use OpenSSL to generate public and private keys for use with their web server. These keys are used to encrypt and decrypt information sent from a user's web browser to the web server.","Information sent from a web browser is encrypted using a public key (sometimes saved in a .PUBLIC file). That information is decrypted using a private key, which is sometimes saved in a file named RSA.PRIVATE . More often, however, OpenSSL private keys are saved in the .KEY or .PEM file formats.","NOTE: RSA.PRIVATE files can be 512, 758, 1024, 1536, or 2048 bits in size."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"private.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
