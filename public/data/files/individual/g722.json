The standard was created and released in 1988 and last updated in 2012. It allowed VoIP application providers and radio broadcasters to incorporate compressed , high-definition audio into their applications and broadcasts.","G.722 has since been improved upon and replaced by new standards, including G.722.1 and G.722.2. While these standards are named similarly to G.722 and are also used to provide high-definition audio, they are not actually based on the G.722 standard. Instead, they were created using entirely different compression technologies."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"g722.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
