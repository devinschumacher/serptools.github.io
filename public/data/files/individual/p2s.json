The filenames are saved with a combination of a game serial number and a CRC code, as well as a slot number. SLUS-12345_(0D386A2).00.p2s is an example filename, where \"SLUS-12345\" is the serial number, (0D386A2) is the CRC code, and \"00\" is the slot number.","The serial code prefixes (e.g., \"SLUS\") indicate the region for the game disc release. For example, \"SLUS\" refers to NTSC-US (U.S.) releases, \"SCUS\" refers to NTSC-U/C (U.S. plus Canada) releases, \"SLES\" and \"SCES\" refer to PAL-E (Europe) releases, and \"SCPS,\" \"SLPA,\" \"SLPM,\" and \"SLPS\" refer to NTSC-J (Japan) releases.","The P2S format was introduced with PCSX2 version 0.9.8. These states are not compatible with older versions. Additionally, older save states, which do not use a file extension, are not compatible with the 0.9.8 version of PCSX2."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"p2s.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
