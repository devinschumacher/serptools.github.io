Developers write these webpages using Java code, HTML , and sometimes, XML.","JSPs that contain XML are saved as JSPX files. Any web server that includes a JSP-compatible servlet container, such as Apache Tomcat or Jetty, can render a JSPX file as a webpage in users' web browsers. You can also use the Java Virtual Machine to run a JSPX file in any web browser that supports Java Server Pages.","NOTE: JSPX files were formerly known as XML JavaServer Pages. The Eclipse Foundation rebranded Java Enterprise Edition as Jakarta Enterprise Edition in 2018."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/jspx_740.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .jspx file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"JSPX file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"jspx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
