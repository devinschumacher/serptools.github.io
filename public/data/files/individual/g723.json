It is related to both the G.721 standard and the G.726 standard, which also describe codecs used to transmit spoken audio over a network. G.726 is the newest of these standards; it replaced both the G.721 and G.723 standards.","Primarily, the G.723 audio was used to encode audio transmitted over international or wireless phone networks. So, a G723 audio file likely contains audio spoken during a phone conversation."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"g723.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
