Editors can place each asset in its own layer upon VSDC Video Editor's timeline, clip, trim, or extend each asset, and add a variety of visual effects to their movie, including transitions and color styles.","When a video editor saves a VSDC Video Editor project, the project is saved as a VPROJ file. VPROJ files do not actually contain the assets imported into a VSDC Video Editor project. Instead, they contain references to the locations at which the project's assets are stored. If you move an asset used in a VSDC Video Editor project, your VPROJ file may not open correctly in VSDC Video Editor.","After an editor finishes editing their video, they can export their finished project as an .AVI , .MPG , .MOV , or .MKV file, among other video formats. VSDC Video Editor allows editors to select the device their video will be played on, so the editor can export their video in a format optimized for that device."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/vproj_12009.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .vproj file in VSDC Video Editor 6.6","caption":"VPROJ file open in VSDC Video Editor 6.6"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vproj.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
