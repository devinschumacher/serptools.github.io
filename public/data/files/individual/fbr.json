Using FlashBack Pro Recorder, a user can record the actions they take on their computer. (For example, a user might create a recording for use as a video tutorial.) FlashBack Pro saves screen recordings as FBR files.","After creating an FBR file, a user can open that file with FlashBack Pro Player. Doing so allows the user to watch, edit, and export the recording they created. For example, a user could trim their screen recording, add text and transitions, and then export the edited recording as an .MP4 file. (They can also save the edited recording as an FBR file, if they plan to continue editing it in the future.)"]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/fbr_3367.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .fbr file in Blueberry FlashBack Pro Player","caption":"FBR file open in Blueberry FlashBack Pro Player"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"fbr.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
