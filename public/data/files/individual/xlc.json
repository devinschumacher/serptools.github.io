You could then save the chart within an Excel spreadsheet ( .XLS file) or separately as an XLC file.","You can still create charts within Excel by selecting Insert → Recommended Charts , and then adjust their settings in the \"Chart Design\" tab. Instead of allowing you to save the charts in a separate XLC file, Excel saves the chart in the spreadsheet.","NOTE: XLC files are now rare since Microsoft Excel no longer supports them."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"xlc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
