The final section of this manual describes system-administration commands, daemons , and hardware-related commands. Each page of the manual is saved as a separate 8 file, named for the command it describes.","For example, the file shutdown.8 contains documentation related to the shutdown command. It includes a quick overview of how to use the command, a detailed description of the command, a list of command-level options, and other related information.","NOTE: Other sections' Unix man pages use the .1 , .2 , .3 , .4 , .5 , .6 , and .7 extensions. Man pages are also commonly compressed into .GZ files (which may use the .gz.# extension)."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/8_12583.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .8 file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"8 file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"8.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
