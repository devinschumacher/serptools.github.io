It is visually lossless , meaning the visual effect of compression is almost impossible to detect. The improved compression produces images up to 55% smaller than comparable JPEG images and 25% smaller than comparable .AVIF files.","Both digital cameras and websites may use JXL files. The JPEG XL format is especially useful in responsive web environments, where images are rendered in different visual sizes. The extra compression allows web developers to publish large images with smaller file sizes than standard JPEG files.","JPEG XL supports:","In contrast to other modern image formats, such as .AVIF , .WEBP , and .HEIF , JXL images can be decoded using progressive decoding. This allows web browsers to show low-quality preview images to users before fully decoding a JXL file.","NOTE: On September 9, 2024, Apple announced the iPhone 16 Pro will support JPEG XL image capture."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/jxl_11914.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .jxl file in XnViewMP","caption":"JXL file open in XnViewMP"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"jxl.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
