The music sequencing program allows you to create music by organizing notes in different channels as patterns that play samples stored in instruments ( .ITI files).","In Impulse Tracker, you can save your modules as IT files, which you can share with other audio-tracker users who can import them into software that supports the module format. IT files are similar to ScreamTracker 3 modules ( .S3M files) but support more data per pattern and higher-quality samples."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/it_1018.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .it file in OpenMPT 1","caption":"IT file open in OpenMPT 1"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"it.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
