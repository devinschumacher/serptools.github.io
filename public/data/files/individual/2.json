The second section of this manual includes documentation related to Unix system calls. Each call's documentation is stored in a separate 2 file.","For example, the file link.2 contains documentation related to the link and linkat system calls. It includes a quick synopsis of how to use the call, a detailed description of the call, sections describing the call's return values, possible errors, versions, and bugs, and a list of related manual pages.","NOTE: Other sections' Unix man pages use the .1 , .3 , .4 , .5 , .6 , .7 , and .8 extensions. Man pages are also commonly compressed into .GZ files (which may use the .gz.# extension)."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/2_12577.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .2 file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"2 file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"2.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
