{"slug":"carote","extension":"carote","name":"Carote Ransomware Encrypted File","category":"carote-ransomware-encrypted-file","summary":"","developer_org":"n-a","developer_name":"N/A","more_information":{"description":["Carote ransomware renames standard files that are important to you with a .carote extension. The files are typically documents, images, videos, and backup files, such as .DOCX , .PDF , .TIFF , and .DB files.","The purpose of ransomware is to take your files hostage and force you to pay the perpetrator to unlock your files. It may be introduced to your computer through an executable file disguised as another type of file. This is typically done using email spam with attached files disguised as bank receipts or company invoices.","Once the executable file is run, it begins scrambling your files, encrypting them, and appending the .carote extension onto the files. For example, an example.docx file becomes example.docx.carote . The virus then generates a .TXT ransom note ( _readme.txt ) informing you of the takeover and what you are meant to do to recover your files.","NOTE: CAROTE files became prevalent in August 2019 and are similar to encrypted .BLOWER files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"carote.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
