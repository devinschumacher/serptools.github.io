These certificates are saved in various formats, including the CRT format.","After receiving a certificate, administrators must place it on their web server, within the website they want to secure. When a user accesses the site, the web server passes the certificate to the user's web browser, to verify the site's identity. (If a browser cannot verify a certificate, it may instead show a page that says \"This website's certificate is expired.\")","NOTE: To view the contents of a secure website's digital certificate, click the lock icon that appears in your website's address bar."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"crt.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
