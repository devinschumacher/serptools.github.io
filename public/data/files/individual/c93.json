Only one version of one of those games uses C93 files. Cyberia was released for Windows, Macintosh, Sony PlayStation, and a handful of other platforms, but only its DOS release includes C93 files. The \"93\" in C93 likely refers to 1993, the year Interplay created the file format.","In 1995, Interplay resurrected and upgraded the C93 format for use in Cyberia 2: Resurrection. This modified video format was named, appropriately, M95."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/c93_11618.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .c93 file in VLC media player","caption":"C93 file open in VLC media player"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"c93.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
