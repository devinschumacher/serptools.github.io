The templating engine may be utilized on the frontend (executed in web browsers) or on the backend (executed with NodeJS, a JavaScript runtime environment) of websites. Some dynamic websites that may incorporate EJS include online stores or directories that store profile information for people.","An EJS template typically contains mostly static elements that make up the structure of the page along with one or more dynamic elements. The dynamic elements will be filled in with data from an external source, like a database, at a later time when the user requests the webpage.","For example, one EJS template could be used for multiple product webpages The template contains static elements for the page layout that make the appearance of the product pages similar. However, it also stores dynamic elements (\"productname\" and \"productdescription\" tags in this example) that will be filled in with the product name and description from a database when a user requests the page.","You can open EJS files with any text editor, since the files are saved in plain text format. However, you may want to use a source code editor that supports the language or allows you to install a plugin that supports the language to provide helpful coding features.","NOTE: EJS is one of several JavaScript templating engines used by web developers, along with Pug (formerly Jade), Mustache, Handlebars, HAML, Vash, and Nunjucks."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/ejs_11499.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .ejs file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"EJS file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ejs.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
