The XML metadata file is used by TiVo to help organize the recorded content on the TiVo DVR device. Examples of metadata in the XML file include the TV show or movie title, a description of the recording, and the date the content was recorded.","You will most likely only encounter a TMF file if you own an older TiVo DVR device and are transferring recorded content from the device using the MFS_FTP server program included with the device. When doing this, the program combines the various chunks of video and audio data into multiple TY files, along with the XML metadata file and packages them in a tarball.","NOTE: TiVo recordings are also commonly saved as .TIVO files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tmf.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
