{"slug":"spwn","extension":"spwn","name":"SPWN Geometry Dash Trigger Modifier","category":"spwn-geometry-dash-trigger-modifier","summary":"","developer_org":"spu7nix","developer_name":"Spu7nix","more_information":{"description":["Geometry Dash is a music-based platforming game in which players must click or tap in time to music to avoid obstacles. It is available for iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS.","Typically, Geometry Dash players create custom levels using the game's level creation tools. Players who want finer control over the level creation process can modify levels using SPWN, a player-created programming language. SPWN allows players to write and compile code that modifies a Geometry Dash level's triggers, making it easier to create complex levels.","Players save SPWN source code files with the .spwn extension. These files mainly consist of SPWN trigger functions, such as move , collision , death , etc., and code implemented using those functions. After finalizing a SPWN file, players can apply it to a Geometry Dash level using the SPWN compiler."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"spwn.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
