However, ZDL files are created by DesignPro 5.0, while ZDP files are created by DesignPro 3.5 - 4.0 and ZDS files are created by DesignPro 5.1 and later.","You can create and open ZDL files with DesignPro. However, DesignPro was discontinued and replaced by Design & Print, which can also be used to open ZDL files.
