Developers creating Rust programs might compile and package a group of common or related functions into an RLIB archive file. Each RLIB file contains multiple .O files, metadata saved in a lib.rmeta file, and a symbol table.","To use the functions an RLIB file contains, developers reference the functions in their program and then link the RLIB file to their program during the compilation process. Developers can reference and link RLIB files to multiple programs, making it easy to reuse (and maintain) the functions they contain.","NOTE: RLIB files created by one version of rustc may not be compatible with other versions of rustc."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"rlib.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
