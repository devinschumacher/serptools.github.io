This can be useful in situations in which a user wants to copy and transfer a file to another user, and needs to know the other user received an exact copy of the file. In this scenario, the user can use a checksum utility to produce a checksum for the original file and its duplicate. If the checksums match, the files are identical.","Many checksum utilities, including MooSFV, QuickSFV, and Traction SFV Checker, allow users to create checksums for a group of files at the same time. Each file's name and its checksum are then saved in an SFV file. When a user transfers the group of files to a CD, DVD, USB drive, or other storage device, they can also transfer the SFV file to that device. This gives the user who receives the device an easy way to verify that none of the files stored on the device were corrupted during the transfer.","SFV files may also accompany files downloaded from the Internet. This allows users to verify that the files they downloaded were not corrupted or altered during the download."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/sfv_518.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .sfv file in Traction SFV Checker 2.04","caption":"SFV file open in Traction SFV Checker 2.04"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sfv.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
