Previous versions of InCopy (CS3 and earlier) saved documents as .INCX files. ICML is the primary file type associated with InCopy and is a working document, which means you can save the file, close it, then re-open it to continue editing it.","You may also utilize ICML files to link portions of an Adobe InDesign document ( .INDD file) via a network fileserver. For example, you can link a subset with InDesign, such as a text or graphics frame, of an INDD file to one or more ICML files and grant them editing permissions using an .ICMA assignment file. Once you edit the ICML files, InDesign automatically updates the content in the document.","Typically, you will not directly open ICML files linked to an ICMA assignment file. Instead, when you \"edit\" an ICMA assignment file, you are modifying ICML files behind the scenes using InCopy."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/icml_4815.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .icml file in Adobe InCopy 2023","caption":"ICML file open in Adobe InCopy 2023"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"icml.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
