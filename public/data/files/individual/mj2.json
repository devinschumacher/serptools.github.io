As part of this development, JPEG also created the Motion JPEG 2000 video format, also known as MJ2 or MJP2.","MJ2 videos are comprised of a series of JPEG 2000 images. They also often contain accompanying audio. Unlike traditional .MPEG videos, MJ2 videos do not use inter-frame coding. Instead, each frame is coded independently. This makes it easier for videographers and editors to access high-quality versions of each frame, but it also increases MJ2 videos' file size.","Many digital movie cameras save footage and accompanying audio as MJ2 files. Some medical imaging and satellite imaging devices also save videos as MJ2 files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mj2.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
