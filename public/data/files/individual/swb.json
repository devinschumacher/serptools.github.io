This saves the project as an SWB file. SWB files include everything needed to load the project in Sketchware Pro, including any custom libraries and blocks created specifically for the project.","Developers often share SWB files with each other, either online or via SWB-sharing apps. For example, the app Sketchware SWB Projects allows developers to download other Sketchware Pro users' SWB files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"swb.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
