This allows you to restore the file if necessary. When you empty your Trash while the USB flash drive is connected to your computer, macOS automatically deletes all files in the drive's .TRASHES folder.","In macOS, you can see the .TRASHES folder by pressing CMD + SHIFT + . to show hidden files. You can also see the .TRASHES folder in Windows using File Explorer and ChromeOS using the Files app.","As long as you are okay with losing the copies of to-be-deleted files stored in the .TRASHES folder, you can delete the folder and files to free up space on your USB flash drive.","NOTE: iOS devices can also create .TRASHES folders on USB flash drives connected to them."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/trashes_11005.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .trashes file in Apple Finder","caption":"TRASHES file open in Apple Finder"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"trashes.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
