Since Machine Learning Server may be implemented by a variety of organizations, XDF files may store various types of data depending on the context in which they are used. For example, an airline may use Machine Learning Server to record and analyze on-time performance data. The corresponding XDF file might include the departure time, arrival time, flight number, origin airport, destination airport, flight distance, and date of each flight.","XDF files often store large amounts of recorded data in a single file. However, as data sets grow, XDF files may be split into smaller, compressed files to save space. Each block of data stored in an XDF file can be compressed at a custom level.","NOTE: While XDF files are typically created by Machine Learning Server software, the files may also be created by other programs, such as XDF Output tool."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"xdf.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
