Those prototypes, referred to as assemblies, are saved in IAM files.","After finalizing an assembly, users can test how their prototype would perform in the real world using Inventor's motion simulation and stress analysis tools. They can also share their IAM file with others using Inventor's cloud-based sharing tools and Autodesk Viewer.","NOTE: Inventor users who also use Autodesk AutoCAD can transform a 2D .DWG drawing into a 3D IAM file by importing the drawing into Inventor."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/iam_2636.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .iam file in Autodesk Inventor 2022","caption":"IAM file open in Autodesk Inventor 2022"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"iam.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
