However, they are also optimized for download speed and load time at runtime, which makes them easier to use in mobile- and web- based 3D modeling programs. They are also a more streamlined format for uploading and downloading from online digital asset databases, such as 3D Warehouse and Remix 3D.","GLB files are similar to GLTF files in that they may include embedded resources or may reference external resources. If a GLB file comes with separate resources, they most likely will be the following files:","The glTF is developed to be an efficient, extensible, interoperable format for the transmission and loading of 3D content. The goals of the format include, compact file sizes, fast loading, complete 3D scene representation, runtime independence, and extensibility to accompany further development.
