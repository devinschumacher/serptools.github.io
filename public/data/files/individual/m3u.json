Playlists used to play local files include file paths that point to those files. Playlists used to stream media include URLs that point to that media.","The M3U format was originally designed to describe audio playlists, comprised of .MP3 , .WAV , and other audio files. However, the format is now commonly used to save video playlists, comprised of .MP4 , .TS , and .WEBM files. Note that M3U files do not contain the media itself. Instead, they contain information used to open and play media files.","NOTE: M3U is short for MP3 URL, which is itself short for Moving Picture Experts Group Audio Layer 3 Uniform Resource Locator.","Many media players that can create playlists can save those playlists as M3U files. For example, you can create an M3U playlist in VideoLAN VLC media player by loading a queue of media files, selecting Media → Save Playlist to File or File → Save Playlist... , and saving the playlist in the M3U format."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/m3u_460.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .m3u file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"M3U file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"m3u.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
