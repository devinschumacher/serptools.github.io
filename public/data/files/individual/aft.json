The program allows you to add family members and information about them, such as their name, birth date, and birthplace, then save the information in an AFT file.","When Ancestry.com acquired Family Tree Maker, another ancestry management application, they ceased the development of Ancestry Family Tree and the AFT format. Family Tree Maker supported the AFT format up to version 2005 SE of the software. Since the AFT format is no longer developed, AFT files are rare."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"aft.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
