To that end, the company's word processing program, DavkaWriter, supports both English and Hebrew writing. For example, it includes a Hebrew dictionary, thesaurus, and translation tool.","Documents saved in DavkaWriter are typically saved as DWD files. However, different versions of DavkaWriter use different versions of the DWD format. For example, if you share a DWD file created in a newer version of DavkaWriter with someone who uses an old version of the program, they may not be able to open the file. To circumvent this problem, you must export your file in the old version of the DWD format (by selecting File â†’ Export and exporting as the DavkaWriter, Older Version file type)."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"dwd.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
