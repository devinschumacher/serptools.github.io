While MOHOPROJ files should be opened in Anime Studio Pro or Debut, you can directly open the file by extracting them from MOHO files. To do this, rename the \".moho\" extension with the \".zip\" extension, then extract the contents with the decompression program. You can then use a text editor to open the MOHOPROJ file.","NOTE: Moho was formerly known as Anime Studio before it was renamed in version 12."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mohoproj.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
