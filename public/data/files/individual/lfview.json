These include Leapfrog Geo, Leapfrog Works, and Leapfrog Energy.","Geologists using Leapfrog applications can export the 3D geological scenes they create as LFVIEW files. Other geologists can then open these files with Seequent's free Leapfrog Viewer. This allows geologists who do not have access to paid Leapfrog applications to still view and analyze 3D models created by those apps."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"lfview.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
