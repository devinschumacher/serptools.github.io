For example, a user might create their own OV2 file with TomTom Navigator, Global Mapper, POI Editor, or another mapping application. Or, a user might download an existing OV2 file from a TomTom-related forum.","Typically, users import OV2 files to their TomTom devices by uploading the files to their online TomTom MyDrive. Then, the next time the user's TomTom device syncs to their TomTom account, the device will import the OV2 file and the POIs it contains. However, users can also manually import OV2 files to a TomTom device.","NOTE: Typically, each OV2 file contains a collection of related POIs, such as POIs for a particular city or region."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/ov2_1585.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .ov2 file in POI Editor","caption":"OV2 file open in POI Editor"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ov2.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
