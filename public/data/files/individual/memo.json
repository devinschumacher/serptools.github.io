The MEMO format was used by the Memo app included on certain Samsung Galaxy phones.","Contrary to what you might expect, MEMO files are not text files. Instead, they are Zip-compressed archives that contain an XML file and a Media folder. The XML file contains a memo's text and other data, while the Media folder contains any images, videos, or other media saved within the memo."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"memo.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
