Cheese","more_information":{"description":["Studio C Alpha was a Chuck E. Cheese attraction that featured an animatronic version of Chuck E. Cheese hosting a late-night talk show. In addition to the animatronic version of Mr. Cheese, Studio C Alpha featured lights, sounds, and video content, such as guest interviews.","Intermittently, Chuck E. Cheese would change the content that played in Studio C Alpha. To reprogram how the attraction's animatronic character and lights behaved, a staff member would install upgrade files stored on a floppy disk. Some of these upgrade files were saved as CEC files. Eventually, both the upgrade and video content used to change how Studio C Alpha behaved were stored on USB flash drives."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"cec.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
