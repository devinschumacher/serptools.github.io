For example, if your internet connection is slow, you might wait 20 seconds for an image saved in the baseline JPEG format to completely load line by line on a blank space on the page.","However, a web browser loading a PJPEG image loads scans of the image that progressively increase in quality with each pass. The first scan is a low-resolution version of the image (likely blurry and pixelated) that improves (becomes sharper and less pixelated) as the browser loads the scans (typically 3 to 5).","NOTE: PJPEG files more often use the .pjpg extension ( .PJPG files). However, both files are rare, and most progressive JPEG image files use the .jpg extension ( .JPG files)."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/pjpeg_6124.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .pjpeg file in Apple Preview 11","caption":"PJPEG file open in Apple Preview 11"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pjpeg.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
