The app comes with multiple dictionaries, such as New Oxford American Dictionary and Wikipedia, that you can enable, disable, or order based on your preference.","The Dictionary app comes packaged with many dictionaries, each with a DICTIONARY file named after the dictionary. For example, the name of the Apple Dictionary DICTIONARY file is Apple Dictionary.dictionary .","While the Dictionary app comes bundled with many dictionaries, developers can build custom dictionaries with the Dictionary Development Kit. To create a DICTIONARY file, developers need to create a dictionary source file, prepare a style sheet, edit the property list file ( .PLIST ), and add any resources required by their dictionary.","Different Mac operating systems store DICTIONARY files in different locations. For example, macOS Monterrey stores DICTIONARY files in the following location:","/​System/​Library/​AssetsV2/​com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX","However, earlier versions of macOS store DICTIONARY files in the /​System/​Library/​Dictionary location."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"Apple Dictionary.dictionary","description":"Apple Dictionary.dictionary - Name of the default dictionary included with Apple Dictionary."}],"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/dictionary_12864.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .dictionary file in Apple Dictionary 2","caption":"DICTIONARY file open in Apple Dictionary 2"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/dictionary_12864-2.jpg","alt":"DICTIONARY file open in Apple Finder","caption":"DICTIONARY file open in Apple Finder"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"dictionary.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
