{"slug":"dxs","extension":"dxs","name":"Deus Ex Saved Game","category":"deus-ex-saved-game","summary":"","developer_org":"eidos-interactive","developer_name":"Eidos Interactive","more_information":{"description":["Deus Ex is a critically-acclaimed game in which players play as JC Denton, an agent of the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition. As the game's story unfolds, Denton becomes entangled in a web of secret organizations and conspiracies that threaten the world. Edios Interactive released the initial version of Deus Ex in 2000; it released a Game of the Year edition in 2001.","All editions of Deus Ex save players' saved games as DXS files. Players who have created multiple saves have multiple DXS files, one for each save. Because Deus Ex contains many branching story paths, players are likely to create many DXS files, to allow them to resume their game from before they made a significant in-game decision."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"dxs.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
