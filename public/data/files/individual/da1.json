Each file contains game data, including .TTL , .INS , .and VOC files. Because of the large number of files that accompany the AGT game, the files can be converted into a single .AGX file with the AGT2AGX utility that comes with AGiliTy. This conversion reduces clutter, load time, and game size.","NOTE: DA1 files are similar to .DA2 , .DA3 , and .DA4 files. These files contain game data referenced for different aspects of the game."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"[name of the game].da1","description":"[name of the game].da1 - The DA1 file will have the same name as the game it's created for."}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"da1.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
