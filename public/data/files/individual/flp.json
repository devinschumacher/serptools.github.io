Instead, the files contain references to the audio files. Therefore, if you move an FLP file or the files it references, such as a .WAV sample file, or SimSynth or DrumSynth preset file, the project may not play correctly in FL Studio.","NOTE: FL Studio was formerly known as FruityLoops, which was originally released in 1998.
