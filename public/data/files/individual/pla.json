The software is available for Windows and macOS and has various features for designing and visualizing structural models.","You can save design projects in the native PLN format, but if you want to save a project with all of its resources (instead of references to them), you can save one or more PLN projects as a PLA archive. This is helpful when moving a project to another computer or storing them. However, because the PLA file stores all the contents, it is substantially larger than a PLN file.","To create a PLA file, select File â†’ Save as , then choose \"ARCHICAD Archive Project\" from the \"Save as type\" dropdown menu. You can then choose the elements included in the archive, such as the background picture, linked textures, and loaded library properties. The software also allows you to save projects as PLN project files, .BPN backup projects, and TPL project templates."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/pla_2066.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .pla file in GRAPHISOFT Archicad 26","caption":"PLA file open in GRAPHISOFT Archicad 26"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/pla_13609.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .pla file in Kurtz-Fernhout Software PlantStudio","caption":"PLA file open in Kurtz-Fernhout Software PlantStudio"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pla.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
