It provided several capabilities including support for 64MB magnetic disks for rewritable and expandable data storage. It was a commercial failure.","You most likely will only encounter an NDR file if you are a gamer who enjoys emulating old games on your computer and is looking to play a game from a 64DD disk. When you emulate an .NDD file in Project64, then save your progress as you play the game, an NDR file is saved alongside the NDD file to contain the saved game progress. When you load the game in Project64, the program checks to see if an NDR file is present, then loads any saved game progress."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ndr.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
