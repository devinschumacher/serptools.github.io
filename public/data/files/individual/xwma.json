{"slug":"xwma","extension":"xwma","name":"Microsoft xWMA Compressed Audio","category":"microsoft-xwma-compressed-audio","summary":"","developer_org":"microsoft","developer_name":"Microsoft","more_information":{"description":["xWMA is an audio codec Microsoft provides to video game developers, so they can create audio files that work with Microsoft's XAudio2 API. XAudio2 provides a signal processing and mixing foundation for video games, allowing developers to add high-quality sound effects and background music to their games. On rare occasions, files saved using the xWMA codec are saved with the .xwma file extension. More commonly, they are saved as .XWM files.","XWMA files are very similar to .WAV , .WMA , and .XMA files, which are also saved using Microsoft-developed codecs. XWMA files, however, are used only in video games. As such, you likely will not encounter an XWMA file unless you attempt to extract audio files from a Windows- or Xbox-based video game."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"xwma.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
