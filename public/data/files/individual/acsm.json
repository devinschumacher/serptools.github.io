If you do find an ACSM file, it likely means one of your eBook downloads was interrupted. You can double-click your ACSM file to resume the download in Digital Editions. The ACSM file will be stored wherever your browser saves downloaded files.","NOTE: Even if you use another eReader program, such as Kobo Desktop, you may still receive an ACSM file while downloading an eBook. If so, you must download the eBook using Adobe Digital Editions. After downloading the eBook, you can transfer its .EPUB file to your other eReader program."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"acsm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
