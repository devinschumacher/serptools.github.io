Additionally, the files may be saved in the AMR-NB (Narrowband) or AMR-WB (Wideband) format. Wideband audio supports a broader frequency range, providing better sound quality."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/amr_670.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .amr file in VideoLAN VLC media player","caption":"AMR file open in VideoLAN VLC media player"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"amr.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
