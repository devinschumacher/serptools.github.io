When you install an application on a device running Android 5.0 or later, dex2oat converts the Dalvik code located in the .ODEX file to native code and stores it in an OAT file. Therefore, each app will have a corresponding OAT file. dex2oat is typically located in the following directory on the Android device:","/​system/​bin/​dex2oat/​","NOTE: OAT files were introduced with Android 5.0, which is codenamed “Lollipop\" or “L.” Previous versions of Android use .ODEX (Optimized DEX) files instead of OAT files for optimized executables. The new Android 5.0 runtime, called ART (Android Runtime), uses an ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation method, which improves upon its predecessor’s method of just-in-time compilation. ART replaces the previous runtime, which is called Dalvik."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"boot.oat","description":"boot.oat - This file is created whenever a device's system is upgraded or when the app is booted up for the first time after being purchased.
