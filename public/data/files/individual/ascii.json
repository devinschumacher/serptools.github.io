Computers use the ASCII standard to translate binary data into alphanumeric characters and punctuation, shown in plain text files that may contain anything from program scripts to grocery lists.","Typically, ASCII files are saved with a more common or specific extension. For example, many TXT and .CSV files are ASCII files, as are most .BAT and .CMD files. However, some programs and users may save plain text files as ASCII files, to denote the character encoding the files use."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/ascii_931.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .ascii file in Microsoft WordPad","caption":"ASCII file open in Microsoft WordPad"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ascii.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
