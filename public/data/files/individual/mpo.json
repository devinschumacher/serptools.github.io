The specification allows for saving any number of JPG files in an MPO file, but the most common use is for stereoscopic images.","The Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D series cameras are one of the most common cameras supporting Multi Picture Object images. When digital cameras capture images as MPO files, they capture them with the two lenses on the digital camera, then combine and view them side-by-side as a single 3D image.","The image appears in 3D when displayed on a supporting 3D device like a 3D TV. Various companies, including Canon, Sony, Panasonic, LG, Kodak, and Samsung, support the MPO format. Nintendo 3DS may also create MPO files. The files are 640x480, which is the screen size of the device.","NOTE: Another common stereoscopic image format is the Stereo JPEG Image format, which uses the .jps file extension ( .JPS files)."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/mpo_6054.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .mpo file in StereoPhoto Maker 6","caption":"MPO file open in StereoPhoto Maker 6"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/mpo_6054-2.jpg","alt":"MPO file open in Apple Preview 11","caption":"MPO file open in Apple Preview 11"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mpo.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
