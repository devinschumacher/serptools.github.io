Most notably, Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 both use RARC files.","In some cases, Wii and GameCube games instead store their assets in slightly-modified RARC files. For example, Super Mario Sunshine stores assets in RARC files that are compressed using Yaz0 compression. These RARC files use the .SZS extension, to denote that they are not standard RARC files.","NOTE: RARC files also commonly use the .ARC extension."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"rarc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
