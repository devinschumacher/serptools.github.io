When a developer creates a new Defold project, the program automatically creates a game.project file that resides in the project's root folder. The game.project file contains metadata about the project, such as its title and version, as well as project-level settings that control how the project is loaded and managed in Defold.","For example, if you wanted to share assets used in one game with another, you could use your game.project file's library â†’ Include Dirs setting to specify what folders you want to share with other projects. Then, those folders (and only those folders) would be available to use as a dependency in another game.project file."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"game.project","description":"game.project - The name of Defold's PROJECT files.
