Over the next few decades, the company made several incremental updates to the format, such as adding embedded image support. While Microsoft stopped updating the RTF format in 2008, most word processors still support rich text files.","Since RTF is widely-supported, it is an ideal choice for those who need to transfer and edit documents across multiple operating systems and devices. For example, if you use a Windows PC at work but a Mac at home, you can save a Microsoft WordPad document as an RTF file on your work computer, email the file to yourself, and then open it in Apple TextEdit at home.","NOTE: You may encounter minor formatting discrepancies when opening an RTF file created by one program in another. These changes can be attributed to the different versions of the RTF format that various programs support."],"screenshot":{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/rtf_93.png","srcset":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/md/rtf_93.png 760w, https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/rtf_93.png 380w","alt":"Screenshot of a .rtf file in Microsoft WordPad","width":"380","height":"253","caption":"RTF file open in Microsoft WordPad"}},"how_to_open":{"instructions":["You can open an RTF file with most word processing programs, including:"],"programs":[{"name":"Microsoft WordPad","url":"../software/microsoft/wordpad.html"},{"name":"Apple TextEdit","url":"../software/apple/textedit.html"},{"name":"Microsoft Word","url":"../software/microsoft/word.html"},{"name":"OpenOffice Writer","url":"../software/apache/openoffice.html"},{"name":"Google Docs","url":"../software/google/docs.html"}]},"scraped_at":"2025-08-09T21:58:54.632662","source":{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/extension/rtf","file":"rtf.html"}}
