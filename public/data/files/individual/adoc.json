When an author writes a document that contains AsciiDoc syntax, they typically save the document as an ADOC file.","ADOC files are plain text files that can be opened, read, and edited in any text editor. After an author finishes editing the plain text version of an ADOC file, they typically use Asciidoctor or another text-processing program to convert their ADOC file into a formatted text file. For example, a technical writer may use Asciidoctor to convert an ADOC file into an HTML file, which can be hosted and shared on the Internet as a software manual."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/adoc_9993.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .adoc file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"ADOC file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"adoc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
