Graphic designers use Affinity Publisher to create various printed and online documents.","When a graphic designer saves an Affinity Publisher project, the app saves the project as an AFPUB file. The AFPUB file contains all the information needed to re-open the project in Affinity Publisher, including a record of the graphic designer's edits to the project. That way, the graphic designer can undo or adjust their edits in the future.","AFPUB files often contain links to images and other assets in a page layout project. If you want to avoid preserving links to the assets in an AFPUB file, you can save the project as a package, which automatically creates copies of all linked assets and stores them alongside your AFPUB file. To save an AFPUB file as a package, select File â†’ Save As Package... from Affinity Publisher's menu bar."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/afpub_12006.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .afpub file in Serif Affinity Publisher 2","caption":"AFPUB file open in Serif Affinity Publisher 2"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"afpub.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
