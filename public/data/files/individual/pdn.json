If a user wants to retain a record of the edits and additions they've made to an image, they can save the image as a PDN file (by selecting File â†’ Save As... and selecting PDN in the Save as type: field).","Saving an image as a PDN file allows users to continue editing that image's layers and effects as needed. In contrast, saving an image to any of the other file formats paint.net supports will flatten it, compressing all the image's layers into one."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/pdn_3476.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .pdn file in paint.net","caption":"PDN file open in paint.net"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/pdn_12197.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .pdn file in Dragon Draughts 4.5","caption":"PDN file open in Dragon Draughts 4.5"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pdn.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
