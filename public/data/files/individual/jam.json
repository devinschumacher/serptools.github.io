{"slug":"jam","extension":"jam","name":"Jam STAPL File","category":"jam-stapl-file","summary":"","developer_org":"sony","developer_name":"Sony","more_information":{"description":["JAM files are typically generated by a vendor-specific software program, referred to as the \"Jam Composer.\" PLD vendors then distribute JAM files to customers (device programmers), who program and test a PLD using the \"Jam Player.\" The Jam Player reads the JAM file and provides the facilities needed to program the device in a standard JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) chain. This process used to be carried out using separate command-line tools provided by Altera, but it is now encapsulated in Altera's Quartus design software.","NOTE: JAM files are stored in an ASCII text format. They can be compiled into .JBC byte-code files for a binary representation."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/jam_13620.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .jam file in Figma Desktop App 116","caption":"JAM file open in Figma Desktop App 116"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"jam.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
