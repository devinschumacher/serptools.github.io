Students can save the circuits they create as LOGICLY files, to share them with others or continue editing them in the future.","Each LOGICLY file can contain a variety of circuit components, including (but not limited to) switches, push buttons, light bulbs, logic gates, flip flops, and buses. After a user finishes designing their circuit, they can test out their design by interacting with the circuit's input controls.","NOTE: Logicly also allows users to create custom integrated circuits, which can be shared between projects using .LOGICLYLIB files."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/logicly_10359.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .logicly file in Bowler Hat Logicly","caption":"LOGICLY file open in Bowler Hat Logicly"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"logicly.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
