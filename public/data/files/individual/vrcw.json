VRChat users can do almost anything, including host virtual dance parties, run Dungeons and Dragons sessions, or explore simulated mountain passes, within a VRChat world.","VRChat world developers create worlds using the Unity game development engine and VRChat's SDK. When a developer has finished creating their world, they can upload it to VRChat as a private world, for use with their friends, or a public world, which will then become available to anyone who uses VRChat. In the process, the world is saved as a VRCW file.","VRChat's developers and community test user-submitted worlds in the VRChat Community Labs, before releasing them to the general public. As of 2020, VRChat users had created over 50,000 worlds.","NOTE: Sometimes, VRChat users steal and re-upload other users' worlds, claiming them as their own creations. This practice is generally frowned upon."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vrcw.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
