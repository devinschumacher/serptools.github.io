Most notably, MUN files contain the icons used by many system-level and pre-installed Windows programs, such as Control Panel and Microsoft Paint.","Most often, MUN files are associated with corresponding .EXE or .DLL files. For example, mspaint.exe.mun is associated with mspaint.exe , the executable file that launches Microsoft Paint. However, MUN files themselves are not executable files or libraries.
