When a user uses youtube-dl to download a video, the program creates an .MP4 or .MKV file that contains the video, and it creates several other related files. One of the created files is a DESCRIPTION file.","The DESCRIPTION file contains the video's official YouTube description at the time of download. Users often keep DESCRIPTION files on hand so they can remember what content a downloaded video contained. If a user uploads the video to a file hosting website, they may also upload the DESCRIPTION file to provide context for the video. For example, youtube-dl users who upload videos to the Internet Archive usually upload DESCRIPTION files alongside videos.","NOTE: Tubeup.py, which uses youtube-dl to download YouTube videos and automatically upload them to the Internet Archive, also creates DESCRIPTION files."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/description_12250.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .description file in Apple TextEdit","caption":"DESCRIPTION file open in Apple TextEdit"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"description.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
