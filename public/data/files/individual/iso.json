{"slug":"iso","extension":"iso","name":"Disk Image File","summary":"An ISO file is a disk image that contains an exact duplicate of data from a source disk, such as an optical disc or hard drive . Computer users typically use ISO files to duplicate CD, DVD, or Blu-ray discs for sharing or backup purposes or download ISO files from a website to install software on a computer (e.g., downloading and installing the Windows 11 operating system). Additionally, users can mount ISO files, extract files from ISO files, and burn ISO files to optical discs.","developer":"International Organization for Standardization","developer_slug":"international-organization-for-standardization","category":"Disk Image Files","category_slug":"disk-image-files","rating":4.2,"votes":871,"last_updated":"June 15, 2023","more_information":{"content":["ISO files are saved in an uncompressed format based on the ISO-9660 file system standard for optical disc media (hence the .iso file extension and \"Disc Image\" file type). The files are archives that store all the data from a disk image, including the filesystem information, such as directory structures, file attributes, and boot code. Additionally, ISO files are typically large since they store a lot of data.","Before streaming media, many computer users extracted, copied, and burned ISO files from and to optical discs, such as CDs and DVDs, to copy, share, or back up their contents. ISO files store a sector-by-sector copy of every bit of data exactly from the disc, which is different than copying all files from a disc because the disc header information is lost in the copy process.","Users may also download ISO files from the Internet when installing new software or operating systems since an ISO file contains all the necessary information for installation. For example, you can download an ISO file from Microsoft.com to create a bootable installation media, such as a USB flash drive, or to create a virtual machine running Windows 11."]},"how_to_open":{"instructions":["You can open ISO files in various ways, including mounting an ISO file and extracting files from an ISO file.","Mounting an ISO file is a software process that makes the folders and files in the ISO file readable by the computer (as if you inserted an actual CD or USB flash drive in the computer). In Windows 8 and later, you can mount an ISO file without third-party software by choosing the file and then selecting Manage â†’ Mount in File Explorer.","In macOS, you can mount an ISO file by double-clicking the file. After clicking the file, the DiskImageMounter utility bundled with macOS verifies the disk image's integrity and mounts it after confirming the disk image.","You can extract files from an ISO archive to access individual files, such as .BIN or .CFG files. You can use various archive utilities, including Corel WinZip , 7-Zip , and RARLAB WinRAR to extract files from an ISO file.","While burning ISO files to discs is no longer as common as it once was, you may still want to burn an ISO file to a disc to create a physical backup or share data or media. In Windows 7 and later, you can right-click an ISO file and select Burn Disk Image . You can also burn ISO files to discs with third-party software, such as Roxio Toast and PowerISO ."]},"scraped_at":"2025-08-09T21:58:55.176118","source":{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/extension/iso","file":"iso.html"}}
