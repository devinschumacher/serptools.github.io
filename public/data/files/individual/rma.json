{"slug":"rma","extension":"rma","name":"Rhapsody DRM License Data File","category":"rhapsody-drm-license-data-file","summary":"","developer_org":"realnetworks","developer_name":"RealNetworks","more_information":{"description":["When a Rhapsody user attempts to play a song, Rhapsody uses an RMA file to check whether the user's computer is authorized to play that song. This is how Rhapsody performs Digital Rights Management ( DRM ). Rhapsody's DRM also prevents users from sharing downloaded music with others.","RMA files are often confused with .RM , .RA , and .RAM files, which are also RealNetworks files. However, those file types are associated with RealPlayer media, not Rhapsody.","NOTE: In 2016, RealNetworks rebranded Rhapsody as Napster. It is unknown whether Napster still uses RMA files to perform DRM functions."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"rma.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
