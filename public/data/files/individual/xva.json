One of the Xen Project's management APIs, XAPI, is the core component for several hypervisor management applications, including Citrix XenCenter and Vates Xen Orchestra.","System administrators who want to install the same virtual machine, including a pre-installed operating system and applications, on multiple machines can export that machine as an XVA file, better known as a virtual appliance. For example, in XenCenter, administrators can export virtual machines as XVA files by selecting Tools → Virtual Appliance Tools → Export Appliance... . This preserves a copy of the virtual machine, its operating system, and its applications for later use."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"xva.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
