You will most likely see and use the XLSX file more often because it is compressed to save space and is easier to share with other users. XLSB files are not compressed, making them larger than XLSX files. However, XLSB files may perform more efficiently within Excel because they are saved in the larger binary format.","To create an XLSB file with Excel, select File → Save As , then select \"Excel Binary Workbook (*.xlsb)\" from the file type dropdown menu. Depending on the operating system you are using, Excel saves XLSB files in the following locations by default:","Windows Vista, 7, & 10: C:\\​Users\\​<user name>\\​AppData\\​Local\\​Microsoft\\​Excel\\​XLStart","Windows XP: C:\\​Documents and Settings\\​Application Data\\​Microsoft\\​Excel\\​XLStart","macOS: ~/​Library/​Containers/​com.microsoft.Excel/​Data/​Library/​Application Support/​Microsoft/​Roaming/​Excel/​"]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/xlsb_1761.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .xlsb file in Microsoft Excel 365","caption":"XLSB file open in Microsoft Excel 365"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"xlsb.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
