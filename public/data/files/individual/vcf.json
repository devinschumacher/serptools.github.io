For example, you may export a person's contact information as a VCF file, then import it into a contact-organizing program on your computer.","Since VCF files are relatively small in size, you can attach a file to an email message and send it to yourself or other contacts. They can then import the contact information in the VCF into their own contact-organizing software, often by simply double-clicking the file.","You may create VCF files from scratch by creating a new contact and exporting it. For example, in Microsoft Outlook, you can create a contact, then select File â†’ Save As to create a VCF file.","Or, you can convert other file formats to the VCF format. For example, you can save .XLS or .XLSX files as .CSV files with Microsoft Excel, then convert them to VCF files with a simple converter program, such as \"CSV to vCard.\""]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/vcf_698.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .vcf file in Microsoft Outlook 365","caption":"VCF file open in Microsoft Outlook 365"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/vcf_11934.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .vcf file in GitHub Atom","caption":"VCF file open in GitHub Atom"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vcf.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
