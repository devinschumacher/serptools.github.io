Users can then print the 2D papercraft design, cut out its pieces, and assemble them to recreate the 3D model in real life. Each 2D design contains folding lines, cut marks, and other instructions used to recreate the model.","Users can import many different types of 3D models into Pepakura Designer, including .DXF , .OBJ , .3DS , .LWO , .STL , .KML , and .KMZ files. After the user imports their 3D model, Pepakura Designer unfolds the model and saves its 2D version as a PDO file. Users can click any of their PDO file's 2D parts to see which part of the 3D model that part corresponds to.","NOTE: In addition to being able to view PDO files in Pepakura Designer, users can view PDO files in Pepakura Viewer, a free PDO-viewing software that is bundled with Pepakura Designer."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/pdo_5370.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .pdo file in Pepakura Designer 4","caption":"PDO file open in Pepakura Designer 4"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pdo.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
