The ransomware begins its attack by terminating several common Windows application processes. It then produces a ransom note named *Restore_Your_Files.txt in every folder that will contain an encrypted file. Finally, it encrypts most of a user's files and appends them with the .lilith extension.","*Restore_Your_Files.txt contains instructions a user can supposedly follow to decrypt their files. The note also warns that, if the user does not pay the ransom, the ransomware distributors will leak their data.","Ransomware is most commonly distributed in email attachments and programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and opened an unverified attachment or program, that may be how your computer became infected by Lilith ransomware."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"lilith.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
