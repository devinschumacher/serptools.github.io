If a Samsung Memo user wanted to back up their memos on their PC, they could do so by installing Samsung Kies on their PC, connecting their mobile device to their PC, and using Kies to produce a memo backup file. Memo backups contained a copy of all a user's memos, and they were saved as NMM files.","Eventually, Samsung discontinued the Samsung Memo app in favor of Samsung Notes. For a while, users could use Samsung Kies, Samsung Smart Switch, or Samsung Notes to migrate the memos contained within their NMM files to Samsung Notes. At this point, however, no Samsung programs support the NMM format."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"nmm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
