For example, if myimage.png needs to be synchronized from a remote location, Live Mesh creates a temporary file named myimage.png.wlx in the local directory. When synchronization is complete (when the file is downloaded), Live Mesh removes the WLX file.","NOTE: Live Mesh was discontinued in 2013 and is now Microsoft OneDrive."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"wlx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
