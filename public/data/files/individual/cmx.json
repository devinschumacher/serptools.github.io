For example, you could previously save an image as a CMX file in CorelDRAW and then import that image into Corel Presentations for use on a slide.","However, many Corel programs no longer support the CMX format. For example, you cannot import a CMX file into current versions of Corel Presentations, WordPerfect, or PaintShop Pro.","NOTE: Different versions of Corel programs save CMX files in slightly different formats. Some programs allow you to save CMX files in both the current and legacy CMX formats (the CMX format is also known as the Corel Presentation Exchange Legacy format)."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/cmx_2020.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .cmx file in CorelDRAW 2024","caption":"CMX file open in CorelDRAW 2024"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"cmx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
