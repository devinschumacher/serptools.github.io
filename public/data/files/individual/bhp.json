BonhommePendu is a free version of the game available for Windows and macOS. It is developed by Richard Berger and published on his website, Berric-รก-brac.","BonhommePendu can load wordlists saved as BHP files, allowing players to customize the game. Each line of a BHP file contains a word, written in all-caps, a ; delimiter, and the word's category. If the words a BHP file contains are not associated with a category, BonhommePendu cannot load the file.","NOTE: In addition to downloading BHP files from BonhommePendu's website, players can create and import their own BHP files."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/bhp_13047.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .bhp file in BonhommePendu","caption":"BHP file open in BonhommePendu"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/bhp_13047-2.png","alt":"BHP file open in Apple TextEdit","caption":"BHP file open in Apple TextEdit"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"bhp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
