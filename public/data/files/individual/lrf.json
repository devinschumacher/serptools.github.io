Instead, they can only be played with the LOLReplay software. This is because LRF files capture events that take place during gameplay, and the software re-simulates the events when it is replayed. This allows the file sizes to stay small in comparison to a full-motion video equivalent. It also allows the observer to move over the map, select units, and view the replay from multiple perspectives.","NOTE: LOLReplay is discontinued and no longer available for download."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"lrf.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
