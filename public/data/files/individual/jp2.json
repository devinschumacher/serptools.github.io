It provides several improvements over the JPEG format. However, the main improvement is incorporating a wavelet compression algorithm instead of the Digital Cosine Transform (DCT) compression used by standard JPEG images.","There are many applications for the JPEG 2000 compression standard apart from digital photos and medical images. Some examples include digital cinema, broadcast media, and surveillance video.","NOTE: JP2 files may also be saved as .JPF , .JPC , or .JPX files."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/jp2_611.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .jp2 file in Apple Preview 11","caption":"JP2 file open in Apple Preview 11"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"jp2.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
