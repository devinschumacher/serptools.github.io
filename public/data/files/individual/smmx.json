When you save a mind map, SimpleMind creates the SMMX file to store the contents of the mind map.","If you come across an SMMX file on your computer or as an email attachment, you should open it with SimpleMind since there are no other known applications that support the file type. If you are unable to purchase SimpleMind you can try the free version to open it. However, some of the free versions do not allow you to save the file."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/smmx_10488.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .smmx file in SimpleMind 1","caption":"SMMX file open in SimpleMind 1"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"smmx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
