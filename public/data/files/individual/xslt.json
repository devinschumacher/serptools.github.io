Using XSLT, developers can create stylesheets used to format associated XML datasets and convert them to other file formats (including HTML, plain text, and .PDF ). Typically, XSLT stylesheets are saved as XSLT files. (Some may instead be saved as .XSL files.)","In addition to transforming an XML file's content to another format, XSLT files can be used to add, remove, rearrange, or sort elements within an XML file. To use an XSLT file to transform a corresponding XML file, developers feed both files into an XSLT processor. The processor then creates a resulting, transformed file."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/xslt_1052.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .xslt file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"XSLT file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"xslt.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
