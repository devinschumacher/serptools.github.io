While the VST interface was developed by Steinberg, many DAWs, including Steinberg Cubase, Ableton Live, and Image-Line FL Studio, use the VST interface to allow users to install plug-ins.","In 2008, Steinberg released the third edition of the VST plug-in standard, named VST 3. VST 3 plug-ins load effects from VSTPRESET files, which contain some combination of new instruments, audio effects, or MIDI effects. Each VSTPRESET file is linked to a specific VST 3 plug-in, such that the file can be loaded only from within that plug-in. VSTPRESET files are stored in the VST3 Presets folder.","NOTE: VSTPRESET files replaced .FXP and .FXB files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vstpreset.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
