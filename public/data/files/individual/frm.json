The files are created in the same directory that represents the database to which the tables they are storing formatting information for belong.","FRM files are not meant to be manually opened. Instead, they are referenced by MySQL to format each table in a database.","FRM files are saved along with an .MYD file, which contains the actual data stored in the database. Both files are necessary for MySQL to recognize the database. If the MySQL database uses MyISAM tables, an .MYI file is also used and required.","There are some instances when data in a MySQL database is lost or becomes corrupt. Utilities like Aryson MySQL Database Repair may be used to recover or repair the FRM files that store the lost formatting information.","NOTE: FRM is short for \"FoRMat.\""]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/frm_1500.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .frm file in ADL Software ADLForms 6.7","caption":"FRM file open in ADL Software ADLForms 6.7"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"frm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
