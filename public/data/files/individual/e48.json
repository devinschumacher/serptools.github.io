Additionally, an Emu48 port , Emu48 for Android, allows users to emulate these calculators on their Android devices.","When a user saves their Emu48 session, the program saves the user's current state as a file whose extension matches the user's calculator. E48 files contain sessions created while emulating an HP48 graphing calculator. Emu48 also saves users' states as .e38 , .e39 , .e49 , and .w48 files.","NOTE: An E48 file does not contain an Emu48 ROM. It contains only a record of a user's Emu48 session. To open an E48 file in Emu48, you must also possess and load an HP48 graphing calculator ROM image."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"e48.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
