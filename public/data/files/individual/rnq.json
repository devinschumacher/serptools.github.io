In a DES model, systems are represented as sequences of events that occur at specific points in time.","DES model examples include a customer arriving at a service desk, a machine beginning a task, or an item being shipped. These simulations enable users to test various scenarios, identify bottlenecks, and inform data-driven decisions without impacting real-world operations."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"rnq.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
