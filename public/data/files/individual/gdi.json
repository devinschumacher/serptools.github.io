It cannot be burned on a CD-ROM like .CDI files. GDI files come from the GD-R discs that Sega Dreamcast used and can only be burned using GD-Roms and blank GD-R discs. GD-ROMs are similar to CD-ROMs except they read or burn GD-R discs, the \"GD\" stands for Gigabyte Disc. The original Dreamcast GD discs are comprised of 1.2 GB , where around 200 MB of the disc is often dedicated to music tracks which is why BIN files appear.","NOTE: Both CDI and GDI files work for Dreamcast emulators, but GDI is more efficient."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gdi.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
