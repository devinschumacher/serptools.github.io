{"slug":"deh","extension":"deh","name":"DeHackEd Patch","category":"dehacked-patch","summary":"","developer_org":"greg-lewis","developer_name":"Greg Lewis","more_information":{"description":["Doom is a popular first-person shooter video game that was released in 1993. In Doom's infancy, developer Greg Lewis created the DeHackEd editor, which allowed players to modify Doom's gameplay. DeHackEd users created patches, saved in DEH files, that they then applied to Doom's executable file . This created a custom executable named doomhack.exe , which players could launch to play their custom version of Doom.","Over the years, Doom modders have developed easier and more flexible methods of modifying Doom's gameplay. As a result, most current Doom modders do not use DeHackEd or DEH files. However, some modders continue to enjoy the challenge and nostalgia of using DEH-based mods, so some Doom modding programs still support DEH files. For example, the GZDoom modding platform allows players to import DEH files and save them as custom WAD files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"deh.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
