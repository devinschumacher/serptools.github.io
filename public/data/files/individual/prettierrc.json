Some of these guidelines can be adjusted using Prettier configuration files. For example, a developer can use a configuration file to set whether formatted code will include single quotes or double quotes, or whether the code will include a semicolon at the end of every statement.","Some Prettier configuration files are saved as PRETTIERRC files. These files contain a list of a user's Prettier settings, formatted using JSON or YAML. Other Prettier configuration files may contain JavaScript- or TOML-formatted lists of settings.","NOTE: PRETTIERRC files may also contain settings overrides, used to override a setting when formatting code saved in certain folders or files."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/prettierrc_12360.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .prettierrc file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"PRETTIERRC file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"prettierrc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
