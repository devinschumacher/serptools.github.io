Most of these programs are meant to be installed on microcontrollers. For example, a student can use the Chibi Chip MakeCode editor to create a program for use with the Chibi Chip microcontroller, and then install the program on their Chibi Chip.","MakeCode also includes a Minecraft mod creation tool that allows students to create and install mods for Minecraft for Windows 10 and Minecraft: Education Edition. The programs that students create in MakeCode's Minecraft and Chibi Chip editors are both saved as MKCD files. To ensure students do not attempt to open an MKCD file created using one editor in the other editor, MakeCode adds an identifying prefix to all MKCD files that users download.","NOTE: Programs created using other MakeCode editors are saved using the .UF2 and .HEX extensions."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/mkcd_12309.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .mkcd file in Minecraft Microsoft MakeCode Editor","caption":"MKCD file open in Minecraft Microsoft MakeCode Editor"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mkcd.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
