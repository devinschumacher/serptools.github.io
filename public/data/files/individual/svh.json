It is a combination of hardware description language (HDL) features and hardware verification language (HVL) features with C and C++ features. It was adopted as IEEE Standard 1800-2005 in 2005, with the IEEE Standard 1800-2009 released in 2009 and IEEE 1800-2017 released in 2017.","NOTE: IEEE stands for Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/svh_10964.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .svh file in Sigasi Studio 3.8","caption":"SVH file open in Sigasi Studio 3.8"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"svh.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
