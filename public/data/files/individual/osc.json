This map is saved in a file named planet.osm , which is hosted at OpenStreetMap.org.","To make edits to planet.osm , users download a section of the file (saved in the OSM format), edit it using any OSM editor (such as Java OpenStreetMap), and then upload their edits to OpenStreetMap.org. This open editing process can result in users possessing different versions of the same OSM dataset (such as a map describing a region).","If a user wants to review the differences between two sets of similar OSM data, they can use Osmosis, Osmium, or another OSM diff tool to analyze both OSM files and create an OSC file. The OSC file describes the differences between the two OSM files. Using Osmosis, Osmium, and other tools, users can also use an OSC file to apply the changes the file describes to an applicable set of OSM data.","OpenStreetMap also publishes new OSC files each day, which describe all changes users made to planet.osm (and region-specific segments of the file) during the previous day. Users can apply these OSC files to their existing OSM files to incorporate the changes they describe."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/osc_6263.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .osc file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"OSC file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"osc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
