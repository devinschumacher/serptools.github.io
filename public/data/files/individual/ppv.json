Pocket PowerPoint was released in 2000 as part of the mobile version of Microsoft Office for the Pocket PC 2000. Through the years, support for the PPV format has ceased. There are no known programs that can open the format, which means PPV files can only be opened by Windows CE devices."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ppv.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
