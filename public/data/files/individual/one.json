OneNote is often used in corporate settings, to give multiple stakeholders access to the notes recorded during meetings.","When a user creates a new OneNote notebook, that notebook is automatically saved as a ONE file. The file is automatically re-saved as the user (or any other user who can access the notebook) types notes or makes any other edits in the notebook. In addition to being able to type notes, users can insert images, drawings, shapes, tables, and links into the pages of a OneNote notebook.","In the past, OneNote stored ONE files on users' PCs or another local drive. Now, all ONE files are stored in Microsoft OneDrive, which is Microsoft's cloud storage platform. This ensures a user's ONE files are synchronized across all their devices, but also prevents users from being able to export ONE files from OneNote or OneDrive. As a result, users will likely no longer encounter ONE files outside OneNote or OneDrive, unless they stumble upon a ONE file created using a previous version of OneNote."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/one_2945-2.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .one file in Microsoft OneNote for Windows 10","caption":"ONE file open in Microsoft OneNote for Windows 10"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"one.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
