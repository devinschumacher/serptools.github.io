The format became popular among professionals in the publishing industry, including photographers and graphic artists. The format's popularity was partially due to its ability to be edited and re-saved without losing image quality.","TIF files can be saved in an uncompressed ( lossless ) format or may incorporate .JPEG ( lossy ) compression. They may also use LZW lossless compression, which reduces the TIF file size but does not reduce the quality of the image.","NOTE: TIF files may also use the .TIFF extension."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/tif_207.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .tif file in Microsoft Photos 2020","caption":"TIF file open in Microsoft Photos 2020"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/tif_5762.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .tif file in QGIS 3","caption":"TIF file open in QGIS 3"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tif.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
