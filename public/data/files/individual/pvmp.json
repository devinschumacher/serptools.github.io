When you create a VM with Parallels Desktop for Mac, the software creates a PVM file (a macOS package ), to store the contents.","If you need to transfer a VM to another computer, you can pack it as a PVMP file to reduce its size to make it easier to transfer. This functionality is only available in Parallels Desktop for Mac Pro and Business Editions.","To create a PVMP file with Parallels Desktop for Mac, shut down your VM, right-click the VM in Control Center, then select Prepare for Transfer . After packing the VM, the PVM file becomes a PVMP file in the same location."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/pvmp_12867.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .pvmp file in Parallels Desktop for Mac 20","caption":"PVMP file open in Parallels Desktop for Mac 20"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pvmp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
