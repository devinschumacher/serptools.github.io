When a modder creates a new MCreator project, the program saves that project in a new directory (typically, within the MCreatorWorkspaces directory). Each project directory contains an MCREATOR file.","The MCREATOR file describes the project's contents, including mod elements, workspace settings, and the version of MCreator used to create the project. When modders load a project in MCreator, they do so by opening its MCREATOR file. MCreator uses the plain text, JSON data the MCREATOR file contains to find and load the project's assets and dependencies."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/mcreator_12656.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .mcreator file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"MCREATOR file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mcreator.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
