Additionally, you donâ€™t need to manage or open the files since the game generates and updates them automatically.","However, some players may use utilities or modifications to extract or convert UXX files to make custom maps or access game assets for modding purposes. While helpful for improving gameplay, UXX cache files may become numerous over time, potentially taking up much storage space. You can delete UXX files if they take up too much space."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"uxx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
