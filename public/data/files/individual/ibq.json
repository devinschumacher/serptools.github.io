In version 1.9 of IsoBuster, Smart Projects added the ability to create managed disk images. Primarily, users create managed disk images when attempting to piece together all of a disc's data using either multiple CD/DVD drives (which can read different portions of the disc's data) or multiple copies of the disc.","These managed disk images are saved as one or more IBQ files and an accompanying IBP metadata file. After creating an initial managed disk image, users can load and attempt to complete that image by opening it with IsoBuster."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ibq.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
