          "question": "What is HEIC format?",
          "answer": "HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container) is Apple's default image format for photos taken on iPhone and iPad devices running iOS 11 or later. It uses HEIF compression to save storage space while maintaining high quality."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why do I need to convert HEIC to JPG?",
          "answer": "While HEIC offers excellent compression, many devices, applications, and websites don't support it. Converting to JPG ensures your photos can be viewed and shared on any platform without compatibility issues."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will converting HEIC to JPG reduce quality?",
          "answer": "Our converter maintains optimal quality during conversion. While JPG uses different compression, we ensure minimal quality loss while producing files that work everywhere."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I batch convert multiple HEIC files?",
          "answer": "Yes! You can drag and drop or select multiple HEIC files to convert them all to JPG at once. Each file is processed individually and downloaded automatically."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is my privacy protected?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. All conversions happen locally in your browser. Your photos never leave your device and aren't uploaded to any server, ensuring complete privacy."

        },

          "question": "Why convert JSON to CSV?",

        },
        {
          "question": "How does nested JSON data get converted?",
          "answer": "Nested objects are flattened into columns using dot notation (e.g., 'address.city'), while arrays can be expanded into multiple rows or concatenated into single cells depending on your preference."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I customize the CSV output?",
          "answer": "Yes! You can choose which fields to include, set custom column headers, select delimiters (comma, tab, semicolon), and configure how arrays and nested objects are handled."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the maximum JSON file size?",
          "answer": "Our converter can handle JSON files up to 25MB. For larger datasets, consider splitting them or using specialized data processing tools."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is my data secure?",
          "answer": "All processing happens locally in your browser. Your JSON data never leaves your device, ensuring complete privacy and security of sensitive information."
